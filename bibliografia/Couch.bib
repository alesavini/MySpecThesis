abstract = {There is little evidence in the literature regarding the effects of a carbon fiber insert on beam parameters with beam size variations. We demonstrated this effect and noted the magnitude of the change of surface dose induced. It was shown that use of the carbon fiber insert panel, despite providing minimal attenuation of the primary radiation, significantly decreased the skin-sparing effect. The magnitude of this decrease was relatively larger for smaller beam sizes. The surface dose was nearly 4 times as large when carbon was added to a 10 ?? 10-cm beam, and nearly double for a 40 ?? 40-cm beam. Copyright ?? 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.},

abstract = {Background and purpose: To design a consistent set of criteria for acceptability of photon beam dose calculations of treatment planning systems. The set should be applicable in combination with a test package used for evaluation of a treatment planning system, such as the ones proposed by the AAPM Task Group 23 or by the Netherlands Commission on Radiation Dosimetry. Results: Tolerances have been defined for the accuracy with which a treatment planning system should be able to calculate the dose in different parts of a photon beam: the central beam axis and regions with large and small dose gradients. For increasing complexity of the geometry, wider tolerances are allowed, varying between 2 and 5{\%}. For the evaluation of a large number of data points an additional quantity, the confidence limit, has been introduced, which combines the influence of systematic and random deviations. The proposed tolerances have been compared with other recommendations for a number of clinically relevant examples, showing considerable differences, which are partly due to the way the complexity of the geometry is taken into account. Furthermore differences occur if criteria for acceptability of dose calculations are related either to the local dose value or to a normalized dose value. Conclusions: Although it is acknowledged that the general aim must be to have good agreement between dose calculation and the actual dose value, e.g. within 2{\%} or 2 mm, current day algorithms and their implementation into commercial treatment planning systems result often in larger deviations. A high accuracy can at present only be achieved in relatively simple cases. The new set of tolerances and the quantity confidence limit have proven to be useful tools for the acceptance of photon beam dose calculation algorithms of treatment planning systems. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.},

abstract = {Accurate measurement of dose at the surface of a phantom and in the buildup region is a difficult task but one that is important for the proper treatment of patients. The instruments of choice for these measurements are extrapolation chambers but few institutions have these instruments at their disposal. As a result, fixed-separation plane-parallel ionization chambers are most commonly used for this purpose. Recent papers have re-emphasized the inaccuracies in the measurement of dose in the buildup region of normally incident photon beams when using fixed-separation plane-parallel ionization chambers. Data for Co-60, 6-, 10-, 18-, and 24-MV photon beams are presented that show the magnitude of this over response in the buildup region for several commercially available plane-parallel ionization chambers versus results obtained using both an extrapolation chamber and LiF thermoluminescent detectors. Differences in the percent depth dose at the surface of a phantom of greater than 19{\%} were found for one of the chambers. All chambers over responded in the buildup region to some degree based upon their internal dimensions. The appropriateness of published corrections for these chambers is evaluated and guidelines for the accurate measurement of dose in the buildup region are presented.},

abstract = {The purpose of this work is to evaluate the modeling of carbon fiber couch attenuation properties with a commercial treatment planning system (TPS, Pinnacle3, v8.0d). A carbon fiber couch (Brain-Lab) was incorporated into the TPS by automatic contouring of all transverse CT slices. The couch shape and dimensions were set according to the vendor specifications. The couch composition was realized by assigning appropriate densities to the delineated contours. The couch modeling by the TPS was validated by absolute dosimetric measurements. A phantom consisting of several solid water slabs was CT scanned, the CT data set was imported into the TPS, and the carbon fiber couch was auto-contoured. Open (unblocked) field plans for different gantry angles and field sizes were generated. The doses to a point at 3 cm depth, placed at the linac isocenter, were computed. The phantom was irradiated according to the dose calculation setup and doses were measured with an ion chamber. In addition, percent depth dose (PDD) curves were computed as well as measured with radiographic film. The calculated and measured doses, transmissions, and PDDs were cross-compared. Doses for several posterior fields (0 degree, 30 degrees, 50 degrees, 75 degrees, 83 degrees) were calculated for 6 and 18 MV photon beams. For model validation a nominal field size of 10 x 10 cm2 was chosen and 100 MU were delivered for each portal. The largest difference between computed and measured doses for those posterior fields was within 1.7{\%}. A comparison between computed and measured transmissions for the aforementioned fields was performed and the results were found to agree within 1.1{\%}. The differences between computed and measured doses for different field sizes, ranging from 5 x 5 cm2 to 25 x 25 cm2 in 5 cm increments, were within 2{\%}. Measured and computed PDD curves with and without the couch agree from the surface up to 30 cm depth. The PDDs indicate a surface dose increase resulting from the carbon fiber couch field modification. The carbon fiber couch attenuation for individual posterior oblique fields (75 degrees) can be in excess of 8{\%} depending on the beam energy and field size. When the couch is contoured in Pinnacle3 its attenuation properties are modeled to within 1.7{\%} with respect to measurements. These results demonstrate that appropriate contouring together with relevant density information for the contours is sufficient for adequate modeling of carbon fiber supporting devices by modern commercial treatment planning systems.},

@article{Myint2006,
abstract = {Carbon fiber is commonly used in radiation therapy for treatment tabletops and various immobilization and support devices, partially because it is generally perceived to be almost radiotransparent to high-energy photons. To avoid exposure to normal tissue during modern radiation therapy, one must deliver the radiation from all gantry angles; hence, beams often transit the couch proximal to the patient. The effects of the beam attenuation by the support structure of the couch are often neglected in the planning process. In this study, we investigate the attenuation of 6-MV and 18-MV photon beams by a Medtec (Orange City, IA) carbon fiber couch. We have determined that neglecting the attenuation of oblique treatment fields by the carbon fiber couch can result in localized dose reduction from 4{\%} to 16{\%}, depending on energy, field size, and geometry. Further, we investigate the ability of a commercial treatment-planning system (Theraplan Plus v3.8) to account for the attenuation by the treatment couch. Results show that incorporating the carbon fiber couch in the patient model reduces the dose error to less than 2{\%}. The variation in dose reduction as a function of longitudinal couch position was also measured. In the triangular strut region of the couch, the attenuation varied +/- 0.5{\%} following the periodic nature of the support structure. Based on these findings, we propose the routine incorporation of the treatment tabletop into patient treatment planning dose calculations.},

abstract = {In intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT), the use of posterior oblique beams has become common. Beam attenuation by the treatment couch is not negligible when the couch is in the beam portal. In this study, we established the relationship of relative dose vs. beam angle for two Varian 21EX linacs, one equipped with the Exact couch (standard couch) with sliding side support rails, and the other equipped with the Exact image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT) carbon fiber couch. Measurements were performed using an ion chamber placed at the center of an acrylic cylindrical phantom positioned at the linac isocenter for 6 MV and 18 MV photon beams. Measurements were performed at three different field sizes (3 × 3, 5 × 5, and 10 × 10 cm2), and were repeated with the phantom positioned at different longitudinal locations on the couches. To evaluate beam attenuation by the standard couch in a clinical setting, two test IMRT plans and two test VMAT plans on the standard couch were delivered. The plans were generated with the sliding rails at the "in" position and delivered with the rails at both "in" and "out" positions. The dose difference to the ion chamber was determined. For oblique fields with 6 MV photons, the standard couch attenuated the radiation beam by up to 26.8{\%}, while the carbon fiber IGRT couch attenuated the beam by up to 4.1{\%}. In the clinical evaluation, the highest dose difference between rails set at the "in" and "out" positions was 2.6{\%} in the IMRT case and 2.1{\%} in the VMAT case. The magnitude of potential dose difference has been quantified and could be used for a quick estimation of dose difference due to couch attenuation in IMRT and VMAT.},

@article{Butson2007,
abstract = {It is well known that a skin dose from high-energy x-ray radiation varies with the angle of beam incidence or the presence of a radiotherapy linear accelerator couch top material. This note investigates changes produced to the skin dose from a Varian carbon fibre grid couch top at differing angles of incidence for 6 MV x-rays as is often the case clinically. Results have shown that the skin dose can easily be measured using an EBT Gafchromic film whereby the delivered skin dose can be quantified to a high level of spatial resolution, not easily achieved with other skin dose detectors. Results have shown a significant increase in the skin dose specifically at the point of a cross-sectional carbon fibre grid. Values in {\%} of the skin dose increased from approximately 27{\%} (an open area within a 10 cm x 10 cm field) up to 55{\%} (same field size) at the centre of the carbon fibre mesh strip (0 degrees incidence). This is compared to 19{\%} of the skin dose for an open field of a 10 cm x 10 cm beam without the couch material present. At larger angles similar effects occur with values changing from 52{\%} to 75{\%} (60 degrees , 10 cm x 10 cm) in the open area and under the grid, respectively. This produces a wave effect for the skin dose. The average skin dose magnitude increases with the angle of incidence of the beam, ranging from 37.5{\%} to 66{\%} from 0 degrees to 60 degrees (10 x 10 cm), respectively. The symmetric wave nature of the skin dose profile skews to deliver an increased dose on the posterior side of the carbon fibre grid as the angle of incidence increases. Simulated fractional dose delivery on a phantom has shown that over 30 fractions the wave nature of the delivered skin dose is minimized due to the random nature of most patient positioning on the treatment couch. However, some variations are still present as the ratio of the open to grid area is approximately 4:1 and the dose spread is not necessarily completely averaged during a typical fractionated radiotherapy treatment. As such, if the treatment type results in a more rigorously positioned patient on the treatment couch, the wave nature of skin dose delivery may need to be taken into account.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to measure the transmission of the Elekta Stereotactic Body Frame (ESBF) and treatment table, to calculate the transmission of the frame in the Eclipse Treatment Planning System (TPS) using analytical anisotropic algorithm (AAA), and to demonstrate a simple method of accounting for this transmission in treatment planning. A solid water body phantom was imaged inside the ESBF and planned with multiple 3D-CRT fields using AAA using both 6-MV and 16-MV energies. In the first set of plans, the frame and table were included in the "Body" contour and, therefore, used in the dose calculations. In the second set of plans, the frame and the table were not included in the "Body" contour and, therefore, were not incorporated in the calculations. The latter simulated a setup in which there was no frame or table. Eclipse TPS will only incorporate data from the CT set in calculations, if it is included in the "Body" contour. The plans were treated under two conditions: one with the phantom in the ESBF and one without the frame on a specially designed table. This table allows all the beams to enter the phantom without passing through any attenuating material (i.e., table or frame). Transmission of the frame and table was determined by the ratio of the measurements with the frame and table to the measurements without them. To validate the accuracy of the calculation model, plans with homogeneous phantom and a heterogeneous plan were compared with the measurements. The transmission of the frame varies from 89-94{\%} depending on the angle of the beams and whether they also intercept the table. The AAA algorithm calculated the transmission of the frame and table to within 2{\%} of the measurements for all gantry angles. Validation results showed that AAA can calculate the dose to the target to within 2{\%} of the measured value. The attenuation caused by the ESBF must be accounted for in the planning process. For Eclipse, the frame should be contoured and included in all calculations. This can be done easily and accurately.},

abstract = {The objectives of this study are to evaluate the effect of couch attenuation on quality assurance (QA) results and to present a couch top model for Monte Carlo (MC) dose calculation for RapidArc treatments. The IGRT couch top is modelled in Eclipse as a thin skin of higher density material with a homogeneous fill of foam of lower density and attenuation. The IGRT couch structure consists of two longitudinal sections referred to as thick and thin. The Hounsfield Unit (HU) characterization of the couch structure was determined using a cylindrical phantom by comparing ion chamber measurements with the dose predicted by the treatment planning system (TPS). The optimal set of HU for the inside of the couch and the surface shell was found to be respectively -960 and -700 HU in agreement with Vanetti et al (2009 Phys. Med. Biol. 54 N157-66). For each plan, the final dose calculation was performed with the thin, thick and without the couch top. Dose differences up to 2.6{\%} were observed with TPS calculated doses not including the couch and up to 3.4{\%} with MC not including the couch and were found to be treatment specific. A MC couch top model was created based on the TPS geometrical model. The carbon fibre couch top skin was modelled using carbon graphite; the density was adjusted until good agreement with experimental data was observed, while the density of the foam inside was kept constant. The accuracy of the couch top model was evaluated by comparison with ion chamber measurements and TPS calculated dose combined with a 3D gamma analysis. Similar to the TPS case, a single graphite density can be used for both the thin and thick MC couch top models. Results showed good agreement with ion chamber measurements (within 1.2{\%}) and with TPS (within 1{\%}). For each plan, over 95{\%} of the points passed the 3D gamma test.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to evaluate beam attenuation by treatment couch and build a treatment couch model in TPS to check for beam-couch intersection at the planning stage and deal with beam attenuation by treatment couch in dose calculation. In this study, a standard treatment couch, Siemens ZXT couch, has been incorporated into Pinnacle3 8.0 TPS, based on an existing TPS tool, model-based segmentation (MBS). This was done by generating the couch's model from contours of the couch, together with the density information. Both the geometric and dosimetric accuracy of the couch model were evaluated. The test of beam-couch intersection prediction showed good agreement between predicted and measured results, and the differences were within 1° gantry rotation. For individual posterior oblique beams, the attenuation by metallic frames and PMMA couch top could reach nearly as high as 60{\%} and 10{\%}, respectively. For several posterior oblique beams (180°, 220°, 235°) that attenuated by the PMMA couch top, the calculated and measured dose distributions were compared. The dose differences at central axis were within 1{\%}, and almost all points agreed with the calculations when the DD and DTA criteria of 3{\%}/3 mm were adopted. The difference between calculated and measured attenuation factors were within 0.5{\%}. This study demonstrates that the couch model created by MBS, which contains geometric and density information of the couch, can be used to detect the beam-couch intersection, and also is able to provide an accurate representation of the couch top attenuation properties in patient dose calculation.},

abstract = {The impact of the treatment couch on a radiotherapy plan is rarely fully assessed during the treatment planning process. Incorporating a couch model into the treatment planning system (TPS) enables the planner to avoid or dosimetrically evaluate beam-couch intersections. In this work, we demonstrate how existing TPS tools can be used to establish this capability and assess the accuracy and effectiveness of the system through dose measurements and planning studies. Such capabilities may be particularly relevant for the planning of arc therapies.Treatment couch top models were introduced into a TPS by fusing their CT image sets with the patient CT dataset. Regions of interest characterizing couch elements were then imported and assigned appropriate densities in the TPS. Measurements in phantom agreed with TPS calculations to within 2{\%} dose and 1 degrees gantry rotation. To clinically validate the model, a retrospective study was performed on patient plans that posed difficulties in beam-couch intersection during setup. Beam-couch intersection caused up to a 3{\%} reduction in PTV coverage, defined by the 95{\%} of the prescribed dose, and up to a 1{\%} reduction in mean CTV coverage. Dose compensation strategies for IMRT treatments with beams passing through couch elements were investigated using a four-field IMRT plan with three beams passing through couch elements. In this study, ignoring couch effects resulted in point dose reductions of 8 +/- 3{\%}.A methodology for incorporating detailed couch characteristics into a TPS has been established and explored. The method can be used to predict beam-couch intersections during planning, potentially eliminating the need for pretreatment appointments. Alternatively, if a beam-couch intersection problem arises, the impact of the couch can be assessed on a case-by-case basis and a clinical decision made based on full dosimetric information.},

abstract = {The use of rigid carbon fiber couch inserts in radiotherapy treatment couches is a well-established method of reducing patient set-up errors associated with couch sag. Several published studies have described such inserts as radiotranslucent with negligible attenuation of the radiation field. Most of these studies were conducted with the radiation field normally incident on the couch and there appears to be no evidence in the literature of the effect of the gantry angle on the extent of beam attenuation by the carbon fiber insert alone during external beam radiotherapy. In this study we examined the magnitude of this effect over a range of posterior oblique gantry angles using a cylindrical solid water phantom containing an ionization chamber placed isocentrically. It was found that a 6 MV photon beam, field size 10 x 5 cm, was attenuated significantly as the gantry angle approached the plane of the couch, from 2{\%} at normal incidence and reaching 9{\%} attenuation at angle of incidence 70 degrees. This could have serious implications regarding dose to the treatment volume for treatments requiring posterior oblique angles of incidence with a possible correction factor necessary in monitor unit calculations.},

abstract = {When a photon beam passes through the treatment couch or an immobilization device, it may traverse a large air gap (up to 15 cm or more) prior to entering the patient. Previous studies have investigated the ability of various treatment planning systems to calculate the dose immediately beyond small air gaps, typically less than 5 cm thick, such as those within the body. The aim of this study is to investigate the ability of the Eclipse anisotropic analytical algorithm (AAA) and pencil beam convolution (PBC) algorithm to calculate the dose beyond large air gaps. Depth dose data in water for a 6 MV photon beam, 10 x 10 cm2 field size, and 100 cm SSD were measured beyond a range of air gaps (1-15 cm). The thickness of the water equivalent material positioned before the air gap ranged from 0.2 to 4 cm. Dose was calculated with the Eclipse PBC algorithm and AAA. The scattered and primary dose components were calculated from the measurements. The measured results indicate that as the air gap increases (from 1 to 15 cm) the dose reduces at the water surface and that beyond an air gap a secondary buildup region is required to re-establish electronic equilibrium. The dose beyond the air gap is also reduced at depths beyond the secondary buildup region. The PBC algorithm did not predict any reduction in dose beyond the air gap. AAA predicted the secondary buildup region but did not predict the reduction in dose at depths beyond it. The reduction in dose beyond the secondary buildup region was shown to be particularly relevant for air gaps of 5 cm or more when there was a 2 cm of water equivalent material positioned before the air gap. For these cases, where electronic equilibrium is established in the material positioned before the air gap, both algorithms were found to overestimate the dose by 2.0{\%}-5.5{\%}. It was concluded that the dose to depths of up to 15 cm beyond a large air gap is reduced due to a decrease in scattered radiation, produced in the material positioned before the air gap, reaching the point of interest. This effect is not well modeled by the Eclipse AAA and PBC algorithm and may result in dose calculation errors greater than 2.5{\%}. Due to the contribution of other uncertainties in the radiation therapy treatment planning and delivery process, dose calculation errors of this magnitude are not consistent with the recommendation of the International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements that the absorbed dose to the target volume be delivered with an uncertainty of less than +/- 5{\%}.},

abstract = {Purpose: The aim of this article is to provide a quantitative tool to evaluate the influence of the different dose regions in a non-uniformly irradiated tumour upon the probability of controlling that tumor. Methods and Materials: First, a method to generate a distribution of the probability of controlling the cells in a voxel (VCP) is explored and found not to be useful. Second, we introduce the concept of delta-TCP, which represents the gain or loss in the overall TCP as a result of each particular bin in a DVH not receiving the prescribed dose (the same concept is applicable to dose cubes or to a fraction of the bin). The delta-TCP method presented here is based on the Poisson TCP model, but any other model could also be used. Third, using this tool, with parameters appropriate to Stage C prostate tumors, the consequences of 'cold' and 'hot' dose regions have been explored. Results: We show that TCP is affected by the minimum dose, even if it is delivered to a very small volume (20{\%} dose deficit to 5{\%} of the volume makes the TCP decrease by 18{\%}), and that a hot region may be 'wasted' unless the boost is to the bulk of the volume. An example of the application of the delta-TCP concept to a prostate radiotherapy plan is also given. Conclusion: The delta-TCP distribution adds more objective information to the original DVH by enabling the clinician or planner to directly evaluate the effects of a non-uniform dose distribution on local control.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To investigate the attenuation of a carbon-fiber tabletop and a combiboard, alongside with the depth-dose profile in a solid-water phantom. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Depth-dose measurements were performed with a Roos chamber for 6- and 10-MV beams for a typical field size (15 cm x 15 cm, SSD [source-surface distance] 100 cm). A rigid-stem ionization chamber was used to measure transmission factors. RESULTS: Transmission factors varied between 93.6{\%} and 97.3{\%} for the 6-MV beam, and 95.1{\%} and 97.7{\%} for the 10-MV photon beam. The lowest transmission factors were observed for the oblique gantry angle of 150 degrees with the table-combiboard combination. The surface dose normalized to a depth of 5 cm increased from 59.4{\%} (without table, 0 degrees gantry), to 108.6{\%} (tabletop present, 180 degrees gantry), and further to 120{\%} (table-combiboard combination) for 6-MV photon beam. For 10 MV, the increase was from 39.6{\%} (without table), to 88.9{\%} (with table), and to 105.6{\%} (table-combiboard combination). For the 150 degrees angle (tablecombiboard combination), the dose increased from 59.4{\%} to 120{\%} (6 MV) and from 39{\%} to 108.1{\%} (10 MV). CONCLUSION: Transmission factors for tabletops and accessories directly interfering with the treatment beam should be measured and implemented into the treatment-planning process. The increased surface dose to the skin should be considered.},

A set of test cases was developed to assess the overall accuracy of planning and delivery of IMRT treatments. Each test uses contours of targets and avoidance structures drawn within rectangular phantoms. These tests were planned, delivered, measured, and analyzed by nine facilities using a variety of IMRT planning and delivery systems. Each facility had passed the Radiological Physics Center credentialing tests for IMRT. The agreement between the planned and measured doses was determined using ion chamber dosimetry in high and low dose regions, film dosimetry on coronal planes in the phantom with all fields delivered, and planar dosimetry for each field measured perpendicular to the central axis. The planar dose distributions were assessed using gamma criteria of 3{\%}/3 mm. The mean values and standard deviations were used to develop confidence limits for the test results using the concept confidence limit = /mean/ + 1.96sigma. Other facilities can use the test protocol and results as a basis for comparison to this group. Locally derived confidence limits that substantially exceed these baseline values may indicate the need for improved IMRT commissioning.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To measure the effect of the treatment couch on dose distributions and to investigate the ability of a modern planning system to accurately model these effects. METHODS: This work measured the dose perturbation at depth and in the dose buildup region when one of two treatment couches, CIVCO (formerly MED-TEC) or Medical Intelligence, was placed between a photon beam source (6, 10, and 18 MV) and the phantom. Beam attenuation was measured in the center of a cylindrical acrylic phantom with a Farmer type ion chamber at multiple gantry angles. Dose buildup was measured in Solid Water with plane parallel ion chambers (NACP-02 and PTW Markus) with the beam normal to both the phantom and couch surfaces. The effective point of measurement method as described [M. R. McEwen et al. "The effective point of measurement of ionization chambers and the build-up anomaly in MV x-ray beams," Med. Phys. 35(3), 950-958 (2008)] was employed to calculate dose in the buildup region. Both experiments were modeled in XiO. Images of the treatment couches were merged with images of the phantoms such that they were included as part of the "patient" image. Dose distributions calculated with superposition and fast superposition algorithms were compared to measurement. RESULTS: The two treatment couches have different radiological signatures and dissimilar water equivalent thicknesses (4.2 vs 6.3 mm.) Maximum attenuation was 7{\%}. Both couches caused significant loss of skin sparing, the worst case showing an increase in surface dose from 17{\%} (no couch) to 88{\%} (with couch). The TPS accurately predicted the surface dose (+/-3{\%}) and the attenuation at depth when the phantom was in contact with the couch. For the open beam the TPS was less successful in the buildup region. CONCLUSIONS: The treatment couch is not radio-transparent. Its presence between the patient and beam source significantly alters dose in the patient. For the most part, a modern treatment planning system can adequately predict the altered dose distribution.},

abstract = {The effect of a treatment couch on dose perturbation is not always fully considered in intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT). In the course of inverse planning radiotherapy techniques, beam parameter optimization may change in the absence of the couch, causing errors in the calculated dose distributions. Although modern treatment planning systems (TPS) include data for the treatment couch components, they are not manufactured identically. Thus, variations in their Hounsfield unit (HU) values may exist. Moreover, a radiotherapy facility may wish to have a third-party custom tabletop installed that is not included by the TPS vendor. This study demonstrates a practical and simple method of acquiring reliable computed tomography (CT) data for the treatment couch and shows how the absorbed dose calculated with the modeled treatment couch can differ from that with the default treatment couch found in the TPS. We also experimentally verified that neglecting to incorporate the treatment couch completely in the treatment planning process might result in dose differences of up to 9.5{\%} and 7.3{\%} for 4-MV and 10-MV photon beams, respectively. Furthermore, 20 RapidArc and IMRT cases were used to quantify the change in calculated dose distributions caused by using either the default or modeled couch. From 2-dimensional (2D) ionization chamber array measurements, we observed large dose distribution differences between the measurements and calculations when the couch was omitted that varied according to the planning technique and anatomic site. Thus, incorporating the treatment couch in the dose calculation phase of treatment planning significantly decreases dose calculation errors.},

Methods and Materials: RapidArc was used to treat 52 patients at The University of Alabama at Birmingham between May 2008 and April 2009. A single ionization chamber phantom with film and a two-dimensional ionization chamber array were used for quality assurance measurements. Of the 52 patients, 44 had a static gantry dynamic multileaf collimated (SG-DMLC) IMRT treatment plan, seven of which had quality assurance (QA) measurements. Results: The mean difference between ionization chamber measurement and calculation was 1.2{\%} ?? 0.9{\%} (1 standard deviation). For film, the mean fraction of pixels with ?? > 1 (3{\%}/3 mm criterion) was 4.6{\%} and for the two-dimensional chamber array was 1.4{\%}. For the seven corresponding SG-DMLC plans, the results were similar. Differences in important dosimetric indicators were typically within 1{\%} relative to SG-DMLC. The volume of nontarget tissue that received >20 Gy was less for RapidArc compared with SG-DMLC, whereas the volume that received more than 10 Gy was larger. The mean difference between the measured and planned leaf positions and the monitor units obtained from machine log files was 0.0 ?? 0.5 mm and 0.4 ?? 0.3 MU, respectively. Mean delivery times were 1.5 ?? 0.2 and 3.3 ?? 0.4 min for one- and two-arc plans, respectively. On average, SG-DMLC delivery took 4.4 min longer. Conclusions: RapidArc plans have quality comparable to our standard SG-DMLC IMRT technique, and are delivered with similar accuracy in shorter time. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

The literature on skin dose was supplemented with measurements and Monte Carlo simulations. Using all available data, a general dosimetry system was developed (in the form of a series of equations) to estimate skin dose based on treatment parameters including field size, the presence of a block tray, and obliquity of the treatment field. For out-of-field locations, the distance from the field edge was also considered. This dosimetry system was then compared to TLD measurements made on the surface of a phantom. As compared to measurements, the general dosimetry system was able to predict skin dose within, on average, 21{\%} of the local dose (4{\%} of the Dmax dose). Skin dose for patients receiving radiotherapy can be estimated with reason-able accuracy using a set of general rules and equations.},

abstract = {The dosimetric impact from devices external to the patient is a complex combination of increased skin dose, reduced tumor dose, and altered dose distribution. Although small monitor unit or dose corrections are routinely made for blocking trays, ion chamber correction factors, e.g., accounting for temperature and pressure, or tissue inhomogeneities, the dose perturbation of the treatment couch top or immobilization devices is often overlooked. These devices also increase skin dose, an effect which is also often ignored or underestimated. These concerns have grown recently due to the increased use of monolithic carbon fiber couch tops which are optimal for imaging for patient position verification but cause attenuation and increased skin dose compared to the "tennis racket" style couch top they often replace. Also, arc delivery techniques have replaced stationary gantry techniques which cause a greater fraction of the dose to be delivered from posterior angles. A host of immobilization devices are available and used to increase patient positioning reproducibility, and these also have attenuation and skin dose implications which are often ignored. This report of Task Group 176 serves to present a survey of published data that illustrates the magnitude of the dosimetric effects of a wide range of devices external to the patient. The report also provides methods for modeling couch tops in treatment planning systems so the physicist can accurately compute the dosimetric effects for indexed patient treatments. Both photon and proton beams are considered. A discussion on avoidance of high density structures during beam planning is also provided. An important aspect of this report are the recommendations the authors make to clinical physicists, treatment planning system vendors, and device vendors on how to make measurements of surface dose and attenuation and how to report these values. For the vendors, an appeal is made to work together to provide accurate couch top models in planning systems.},

In doing so, one or more beam may pass through different materials like the treatment couch, immobilization cast fixation plate, head and neck rest or any other supportive device. Our observations for 6MV photon beam on PRIMUS-KXE2 with MED-TEC carbon fiber tabletop and 10 × 10 cm(2) field size reveals that the maximum dose attenuation by the couch was of the order of 2.96{\%} from gantry angle 120-160°. Attenuation due to cast fixation base plate of PMMA alone was of the order of 5.8-10.55{\%} at gantry angle between 0 and 90°. Attenuation due to carbon fiber base plate alone was 3.8-7.98{\%}. Attenuation coefficient of carbon fiber and PMMA was evaluated and was of the order of 0.082 cm(-1) and 0.064 cm(-1) respectively. Most of the TPS are configured for direct beam incidence attenuation correction factors only. Whereas when the beam is obliquely incident on the couch, base plate, headrest and any other immobilization device get attenuated more than the direct beam incidence. The correction factors for oblique incidence beam attenuation are not configured in most of the commercially available treatment planning systems. Therefore, such high variations in dose delivery could lead to under-dosage to the target volume for treatments requiring multiple fields in IMRT and 3D-CRT and need to be corrected for monitor unit calculations.},

abstract = {The use of solid carbon fiber table materials in radiotherapy has become more common with the implementation of image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT), since the solid materials give less imaging artifacts than the so-called tennis racket couchtops. The downside of the solid carbon fiber couch inserts is that they increase the beam attenuation, resulting in increased surface doses and inaccuracies in determine the dose in the patient. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the interaction of 6 and 15 MV photons with eight different couch inserts. The presented results enable direct comparison of the attenuation properties of the studied couchtops. With a direct posterior beam the maximum attenuations reach 3.6{\%} and 2.4{\%} with 6 and 15 MV, respectively. The measured maximum attenuation by a couchtop with an oblique gantry angle was 10.8{\%} and 7.4{\%} at 6 and 15 MV energies, respectively. The skin-sparing effect was decreased substantially with every couchtop. The highest increases in surface doses were recorded to be four- and threefold, as compared to the direct posterior open field surface doses of 6 and 15 MV, respectively. In con- clusion, the carbon fiber tabletops decrease the skin-sparing effect of megavoltage photon energies. The increased beam attenuation and skin doses should be taken into account in the process of treatment planning.},

The photon beam attenuation properties of the Siemens image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT) tabletop were studied in detail. Two sets of dosimetric measurements were performed. In the first experiment a polystyrene slab phantom was used: the central axis attenuation and the skin-sparing detriment were investigated. In the second experiment, the off-axis treatment table transmission was investigated using a polystyrene cylindrical phantom. Measurements were taken at the isocenter for a 360?? rotation of the radiation beam. Our results show that the photon beam attenuation of the Siemens IGRT carbon fiber tabletop varies from a minimum of 2.1{\%} (central axis) to a maximum of 4.6{\%} (120?? and 240?? beam incidence). The beam entrance dose increases from 82{\%} to 97{\%} of the dose at the depth of maximum for a clinical 6-MV radiation field. The depth of maximum also decreases by 0.4 cm. Despite the wedge cross section of the table the beam attenuation properties of the IGRT tabletop remain constant along the longitudinal direction.

abstract = {The clinical impact of the Varian Exact Couch on dose, volume coverage to targets and critical structures, and tumor control probability (TCP) has not been described. Thus, we examined their effects on IMRT and arc therapy. Five clinical prostate patients were planned with both 6 MV eight-field IMRT and 6 MV two-arc RapidArc techniques using the Eclipse treatment planning system. These plans neglected treatment couch attenuation, as is a common clinical practice. Dose distributions were then recalculated in Eclipse with the inclusion of the Varian Exact Couch (imaging couch top) and the rails in varying configurations. The changes in dose and coverage were evaluated using the dose-volume histograms from each plan iteration. We used a TCP model to calculate losses in tumor control resulting from not accounting for the couch top and rails. We also verified dose measurements in a phantom. Failure to account for the treatment couch and rails resulted in clinically unacceptable dose and volume coverage losses to the targets for both IMRT and RapidArc. The couch caused average prescription dose losses (relative to plans that ignored the couch) to the prostate of 4.2{\%} and 2.0{\%} for IMRT with the rails out and in, respectively, and 3.2{\%} and 2.9{\%} for RapidArc with the rails out and in, respectively. On average, the percentage of the target covered by the prescribed dose dropped to 35{\%} and 84{\%} for IMRT (rails out and in, respectively) and to 18{\%} and 17{\%} for RapidArc (rails out and in, respectively). The TCP was also reduced by as much as 10.5{\%} (6.3{\%} on average). Dose and volume coverage losses for IMRT plans were primarily due to the rails, while the imaging couch top contributed most to losses for RapidArc. Both the couch top and rails contribute to dose and coverage losses that can render plans clinically unacceptable. A follow-up study we performed found that the less attenuating unipanel mesh couch top available with the Varian Exact couch does not cause a clinically impactful loss of dose or coverage for IMRT but still causes an unacceptable loss for RapidArc. Therefore, both the imaging or mesh couch top and the rails should be accounted for in arc therapy. The imaging couch top should be accounted for in IMRT treatment planning or the mesh top can be used, which would not need to be accounted for, and the rails should be moved to avoid the beams during treatment.},

abstract = {This study is to demonstrate the importance and a method of properly modeling the treatment couch for dose calculation in patient treatment using arc therapy. The 2 treatment couch tops-Aktina AK550 and Elekta iBEAM evo-of Elekta LINACs were scanned using Philips Brilliance Big Bore CT Simulator. Various parts of the couch tops were contoured, and their densities were measured and recorded on the Pinnacle treatment planning system (TPS) using the established computed tomography density table. These contours were saved as organ models to be placed beneath the patient during planning. Relative attenuation measurements were performed following procedures outlined by TG-176 as well as absolute dose comparison of static fields of 10 × 10 cm(2) that were delivered through the couch tops with that calculated in the TPS with the couch models. A total of 10 random arc therapy treatment plans (5 volumetric-modulated arc therapy [VMAT] and 5 stereotactic body radiation therapy [SBRT]), using 24 beams, were selected for this study. All selected plans were calculated with and without couch modeling. Each beam was evaluated using the Delta(4) dosimetry system (Delta(4)). The Student t-test was used to determine statistical significance. Independent reviews were exploited as per the Imaging and Radiation Oncology Core head and neck credentialing phantom. The selected plans were calculated on the actual patient anatomies with and without couch modeling to determine potential clinical effects. Large relative beam attenuations were noted dependent on which part of the couch top beams were passing through. Substantial improvements were also noted for static fields both calculated with the TPS and delivered physically when the couch models were included in the calculation. A statistically significant increase in agreement was noted for dose difference, distance to agreement, and $\gamma$-analysis with the Delta(4) on VMAT and SBRT plans. A credentialing review showed improvement in treatment delivery after couch modeling with both thermoluminescent dosimeter doses and film analysis. Furthermore, analysis of treatment plans with and without using the couch model showed a statistically significant reduction in planning target volume coverage and increase in skin dose. In conclusion, ignoring the treatment couch, a common practice when generating a patient treatment plan, can overestimate the dose delivered especially for arc therapy. This work shows that explicitly modeling the couch during planning can meaningfully improve the agreement between calculated and measured dose distributions. Because of this project, we have implemented the couch models clinically across all treatment plans.},

abstract = {Background and purpose: To investigate the impact of a commercial IMRT/IGRT carbon-fibre tabletop in radiotherapy planning optimization and clinical dose distribution. Materials and methods: In this investigation the Siemens IGRT carbon fibre tabletop, routinely used for IMRT treatments in our Centre, has been incorporated into the CT volume of 6 IMRT patients. This was done by CT scanning the tabletop and by adding the obtained volume to the clinical dataset, acquired using the standard couch available in our CT scanner. This procedure was tested and validated for the purpose of this study. The radiotherapy plans have been optimized using both the original CT volume and the modified CT volume. Results: IMRT optimization with the tabletop included in the clinical volume produced significantly different deliverable plans compared to standard optimized plans which did not include the treatment couch. Differences up to 6{\%}/7{\%} in terms of total number of MU were found in half of the clinical cases. Differences up to 37{\%} in the number of MU per beam were also found. The number of iterations needed to reach an optimal solution also varied between -18{\%} and +25{\%}. Although the DVH analysis produced similar results, due to the fulfilment of the optimization objectives, differences higher than 10{\%} were found in the dose calculated to superficial regions of the body. Conclusions: The results of this investigation show that the presence of the carbon fibre tabletop significantly affects the outcome of the beam parameters optimization. We suggest including carbon fibre tabletops into patient treatment planning dose calculation and optimization. © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Therefore, a new homogenous carbon fibre rotatable treatment tabletop Contesse has been developed. The intension was to create a CT compatible treatment tabletop accommodating all the standard treatment areas without add-on devises or the need to reconfigure the tabletop in everyday practice. At the same time, the absorption was sought to be minimized. Measurements of absorption with an ionization chamber have been performed for the main treatment geometries at normal and oblique angles together with build-up measurements at normal incidence. Absorption and build-up properties were shown to be comparable to those of other treatment tabletops with similar fixation devices. No artefacts from the tabletop are seen on CBCT scans. In order to reveal the absorption characteristics of tabletops, careful measurements at oblique angles including fixation devices on all clinically used tabletops must be performed. The Contesse tabletop is CBCT compatible, has acceptable absorption and is presently being used in the clinic for all patients, including IMRT and kilovoltage CBCT.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Carbon fiber (CF) is now the material of choice for radiation therapy couch tops. Initial designs included side metal bars for rigidity; however, with the advent of IGRT, involving on board imaging, new thicker CF couch tops without metal bars have been developed. The new design allows for excellent imaging at the expense of potentially unacceptable dose attenuation and perturbation.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nOBJECTIVES: We set out to model the BrainLAB imaging couch top (ICT) in Philips Pinnacle(3) treatment planning system (TPS), to validate the already modeled ICT in BrainLAB iPlan RT Dose treatment planning system and to compute the magnitude of the loss in skin sparing.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Using CF density of 0.55 g/cm(3) and foam density of 0.03 g/cm(3), we demonstrated an excellent agreement between measured dose and Pinnacle(3) TPS computed dose using 6 MV beam. The agreement was within 1{\%} for all gantry angle measured except for 120°, which was 1.8{\%}. The measured and iPlan RT Dose TPS computed dose agreed to within 1{\%} for all gantry angles and field sizes measured except for 100° where the agreement was 1.4{\%} for 10 cm × 10 cm field size. Predicted attenuation through the couch by iPlan RT Dose TPS (3.4{\%} - 9.5{\%}) and Pinnacle(3) TPS (2{\%} - 6.6{\%}) were within the same magnitude and similar to previously reported in the literature. Pinnacle(3) TPS estimated an 8{\%} to 20{\%} increase in skin dose with increase in field size. With the introduction of the CF couch top, it estimated an increase in skin dose by approximately 46 - 90{\%}. The clinical impact of omitting the couch in treatment planning will be dependent on the beam arrangement, the percentage of the beams intersecting the couch and their angles of incidence.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: We have successfully modeled the ICT in Pinnacle(3) TPS and validated the modeled ICT in iPlan RT Dose. It is recommended that the ICT be included in treatment planning for all treatments that involve posteriors beams. There is a significant increase in skin dose that is dependent on the percentage of the beam passing through the couch and the angle of incidence.},

abstract = {A planning and dosimetric study was carried out on a cohort of six CT datasets from patients treated for prostate cancer to assess the impact of couch modelling on the accuracy of dose calculation for the volumetric modulated arc technique RapidArc. For each patient, RapidArc plans were optimized using the couch while final dose calculation was performed with different conditions (thin, medium, thick and no couch). Analysis was performed in terms of dose volume histograms, dose difference histograms and 3D-gamma tests. Pre-treatment verification measurements were performed using the PTW-729 array in conjunction with the Octavius phantom (PTW, Freiburg); similarly, HU characterization of couch was performed with the same phantom and ion chamber measurements comparing calculations and experimental data. A set of Hounsfield Units (HU) valid for low and high energy and the entire couch length was found as internal structure HU = -960, surface shell HU = -700. Analysis of dose plans showed that differences larger than 1.5 Gy for a 70 Gy prescription might be observed on significant fractions of PTVs. Smaller differences are visible in the medium low-dose regions. Pre-treatment verification on composite delivery confirmed these observations and, at the same time, showed good accuracy of dose calculations in the presence of couch modelling compared to delivery in the same conditions (GAI ranging from 95{\%} to 100{\%}). Results confirmed the reliability of the geometrical model build in the planning system Eclipse, and (i) there is no measurable effect if the wrong segment of the couch is used in the calculations; (ii) there are significant discrepancies of potential clinical impact at the level of the target volumes if calculations are performed without couch and delivery is performed with couch, and (iii) the effect is particularly relevant at low energy (6 MV in this case) that is the configuration clinically used by most of the centres adopting technologies based on intensity-modulated arcs.},

abstract = {Megavoltage x-ray beams exhibit the well-known phenomena of dose buildup within the first few millimeters of the incident phantom surface, or the skin. Results of the surface dose measurements, however, depend vastly on the measurement technique employed. Our goal in this study was to determine a correction procedure in order to obtain an accurate skin dose estimate at the clinically relevant depth based on radiochromic film measurements. To illustrate this correction, we have used as a reference point a depth of 70 micron. We used the new GAFCHROMIC dosimetry films (HS, XR-T, and EBT) that have effective points of measurement at depths slightly larger than 70 micron. In addition to films, we also used an Attix parallel-plate chamber and a home-built extrapolation chamber to cover tissue-equivalent depths in the range from 4 micron to 1 mm of water-equivalent depth. Our measurements suggest that within the first millimeter of the skin region, the PDD for a 6 MV photon beam and field size of 10 x 10 cm2 increases from 14{\%} to 43{\%}. For the three GAFCHROMIC dosimetry film models, the 6 MV beam entrance skin dose measurement corrections due to their effective point of measurement are as follows: 15{\%} for the EBT, 15{\%} for the HS, and 16{\%} for the XR-T model GAFCHROMIC films. The correction factors for the exit skin dose due to the build-down region are negligible. There is a small field size dependence for the entrance skin dose correction factor when using the EBT GAFCHROMIC film model. Finally, a procedure that uses EBT model GAFCHROMIC film for an accurate measurement of the skin dose in a parallel-opposed pair 6 MV photon beam arrangement is described.},

abstract = {Background and purpose: The use of new materials in radiotherapy requires an investigation of the effects of these materials on the relevant beam parameters. The high strength and low density of carbon fibre suggest an excellent material for table inserts with minimal attenuation, without changing the skin sparing effect in the build-up zone. Materials and methods: In this paper three different carbon fibre plates and two conventionally table top materials are studied in Co-60, 6 MV and 23 MV photon beams. Results and conclusions: From depth dose measurements it is clear that the dose in the build-up zone is influenced in the qualities of the beams. The mutual differences for the three carbon plates are minimal. For Co-60 the depth of the maximum dose is decreased by carbon from 5 to 2 mm and the surface dose is increased from 18 to 76{\%}. For 6 and 23 MV the surface dose is increased from 21 to 52{\%} and 20 to 32{\%}, respectively, as well as the dose in the build-up region. A transmission of 99{\%} was measured for two carbon plates out of three in Co60 and for one out of three in 6 MV.},

abstract = {Computer tomographic (CT) scans are used to correct for tissue inhomogeneities in radiotherapy treatment planning. In order to guarantee a precise treatment, it is important to obtain the relationship between CT Hounsfield units and electron densities (or proton stopping powers for proton radiotherapy), which is the basic input for radiotherapy planning systems which consider tissue heterogeneities. A method is described to determine improved CT calibrations for biological tissue (a stoichiometric calibration) based on measurements using tissue equivalent materials. The precision of this stoichiometric calibration and the more usual tissue substitute calibration is determined by a comparison of calculated proton radiographic images based on these calibrations and measured radiographs of a biological sample. It has been found that the stoichiometric calibration is more precise than the tissue substitute calibration.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To quantify the skin doses resulting from the use of carbon fiber couches (CFCs) for patient support.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMATERIALS AND METHODS: BrainLab's CFC was evaluated for five prostate patients and five lung patients. For each patient PTV, organs at risk (OARs), and a 0.3cm thick skin contour on the patient's posterior surface were outlined. Two sets of IMRT plans, each consisting of 4, 5, 7, and 9 beams, were generated per patient. The sets were identical with the exception that in the first set only 6MV energy was used, while in the second set (mixed energy) the photon energy of the beams traversing the CFC was 18MV. The plans for each patient were normalized to deliver the same dose to 95{\%} of the PTV. The CFC skin dose was evaluated by the maximum dose received by 1{\%} (D(1{\%})) of the skin volume. Paired one-tailed t-tests were used to establish the statistical significance.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The mixed energy plans resulted in D(1{\%}) increase from 18{\%} to more than 23{\%} as the number of beams in the plan was decreased from 9 to 4.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Skin doses as high as approximately 70{\%} of the prescription dose were found even in 9-beam mixed energy plans. Therefore mixed energy plans may be more beneficial for patients treated with higher fractional doses.},

@article{Low1998,
abstract = {The commissioning of a three-dimensional treatment planning system requires comparisons of measured and calculated dose distributions. Techniques have been developed to facilitate quantitative comparisons, including superimposed isodoses, dose-difference, and distance-to-agreement (DTA) distributions. The criterion for acceptable calculation performance is generally defined as a tolerance of the dose and DTA in regions of low and high dose gradients, respectively. The dose difference and DTA distributions complement each other in their useful regions. A composite distribution has recently been developed that presents the dose difference in regions that fail both dose-difference and DTA comparison criteria. Although the composite distribution identifies locations where the calculation fails the preselected criteria, no numerical quality measure is provided for display or analysis. A technique is developed to unify dose distribution comparisons using the acceptance criteria. The measure of acceptability is the multidimensional distance between the measurement and calculation points in both the dose and the physical distance, scaled as a fraction of the acceptance criteria. In a space composed of dose and spatial coordinates, the acceptance criteria form an ellipsoid surface, the major axis scales of which are determined by individual acceptance criteria and the center of which is located at the measurement point in question. When the calculated dose distribution surface passes through the ellipsoid, the calculation passes the acceptance test for the measurement point. The minimum radial distance between the measurement point and the calculation points (expressed as a surface in the dose-distance space) is termed the gamma index. Regions where gamma > 1 correspond to locations where the calculation does not meet the acceptance criteria. The determination of gamma throughout the measured dose distribution provides a presentation that quantitatively indicates the calculation accuracy. Examples of a 6 MV beam penumbra are used to illustrate the gamma index.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: This study characterizes the dosimetric properties of the iBEAM evo carbon fiber couch manufactured by Medical Intelligence and examines the accuracy of the CMS XiO and Nucletron Oncentra Masterplan (OMP) treatment planning systems for calculating beam attenuation due to the presence of the couch. METHODS: To assess the homogeneity of the couch, it was CT scanned at isocentric height and a number of signal intensity profiles were generated and analyzed. To simplify experimental procedures, surface dose and central axis depth dose measurements were performed in a solid water slab phantom using Gafchromic film for 6 and 10 MV photon beams at gantry angles of 0 degree (normal incidence), 30 degrees, and 60 degrees with an inverted iBEAM couch placed on top of the phantom. Attenuation measurements were performed in a cylindrical solid water phantom with an ionization chamber positioned at the isocenter. Measurements were taken for gantry angles from 0 degree to 90 degrees in 10 degrees increments for both 6 and 10 MV photon beams. This setup was replicated in the XiO and OMP treatment planning systems. Dose was calculated using the pencil beam, collapsed cone, convolution, and superposition algorithms. RESULTS: The CT scan of the couch showed that it was uniformly constructed. Surface dose increased by (510 +/-0){\%} for a 6 MV beam and (600 +/- 20){\%} for a 10 MV beam passing through the couch at normal incidence. Obliquely incident beams resulted in a higher surface dose compared to normally incident beams for both open fields and fields with the couch present. Depth dose curves showed that the presence of the couch resulted in an increase in dose in the build up region. For 6 and 10 MV beams incident at 60 degrees, nearly all skin sparing was lost. Attenuation measurements derived using the ionization chamber varied from 2.7{\%} (0 degree) to a maximum of 4.6{\%} (50 degrees) for a 6 MV beam and from 1.9{\%} (0 degree) to a maximum of 4.0{\%} (50 degrees) for a 10 MV beam. The pencil beam and convolution algorithms failed to accurately calculate couch attenuation. The collapsed cone and superposition algorithms calculated attenuation within an absolute error of +/- 1.2{\%} for 6 MV and +/- 0.8{\%} for 10 MV for gantry angles from 0 degree to 40 degrees. Some differences in attenuation were observed dependent on how the couch was contoured. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that the presence of the iBEAM evo carbon fiber couch increases the surface dose and dose in the build up region. The inclusion of the couch in the planning scan is limited by the field of view employed and the couch height at the time of CT scanning.},

@article{Hayashi2010,
abstract = {The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of megavoltage photon beam attenuation (PBA) by couch tops and to propose a method for correction of PBA. Four series of phantom measurements were carried out. First, PBA by the exact couch top (ECT, Varian) and Imaging Couch Top (ICT, BrainLAB) was evaluated using a water-equivalent phantom. Second, PBA by Type-S system (Med-Tec), ECT and ICT was compared with a spherical phantom. Third, percentage depth dose (PDD) after passing through ICT was measured to compare with control data of PDD. Forth, the gantry angle dependency of PBA by ICT was evaluated. Then, an equation for PBA correction was elaborated and correction factors for PBA at isocenter were obtained. Finally, this method was applied to a patient with hepatoma. PBA of perpendicular beams by ICT was 4.7{\%} on average. With the increase in field size, the measured values became higher. PBA by ICT was greater than that by Type-S system and ECT. PBA increased significantly as the angle of incidence increased, ranging from 4.3{\%} at 180 degrees to 11.2{\%} at 120 degrees . Calculated doses obtained by the equation and correction factors agreed quite well with the measured doses between 120 degrees and 180 degrees of angles of incidence. Also in the patient, PBA by ICT was corrected quite well by the equation and correction factors. In conclusion, PBA and its gantry angle dependency by ICT were observed. This simple method using the equation and correction factors appeared useful to correct the isocenter dose when the PBA effect cannot be corrected by a treatment planning system.},
