abstract = {Adaptive radiation therapy (ART) can reduce normal tissue toxicity and/or improve tumor control through treatment adaptations based on the current patient anatomy. Developing an efficient and effective re-planning algorithm is an important step toward the clinical realization of ART. For the re-planning process, manual trial-and-error approach to fine-tune planning parameters is time-consuming and is usually considered unpractical, especially for online ART. It is desirable to automate this step to yield a plan of acceptable quality with minimal interventions. In ART, prior information in the original plan is available, such as dose-volume histogram (DVH), which can be employed to facilitate the automatic re-planning process. The goal of this work is to develop an automatic re-planning algorithm to generate a plan with similar, or possibly better, DVH curves compared with the clinically delivered original plan. Specifically, our algorithm iterates the following two loops. An inner loop is the traditional fluence map optimization, in which we optimize a quadratic objective function penalizing the deviation of the dose received by each voxel from its prescribed or threshold dose with a set of fixed voxel weighting factors. In outer loop, the voxel weighting factors in the objective function are adjusted according to the deviation of the current DVH curves from those in the original plan. The process is repeated until the DVH curves are acceptable or maximum iteration step is reached. The whole algorithm is implemented on GPU for high efficiency. The feasibility of our algorithm has been demonstrated with three head-and-neck cancer IMRT cases, each having an initial planning CT scan and another treatment CT scan acquired in the middle of treatment course. Compared with the DVH curves in the original plan, the DVH curves in the resulting plan using our algorithm with 30 iterations are better for almost all structures. The re-optimization process takes about 30 s using our in-house optimization engine.},

abstract = {In recent years one of the areas of interest in radiotherapy has been adaptive radiation therapy (ART), with the most efficient way of performing ART being the use of deformable image registration (DIR). In this paper we use the distances between points of interest (POIs) in the computed tomography (CT) and the cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) acquisition images and the inverse consistence (IC) property to validate the RayStation treatment planning system (TPS) DIR algorithm. This study was divided into two parts: Firstly the distance-accuracy of the TPS DIR algorithm was ascertained by placing POIs on anatomical features in the CT and CBCT images from five head and neck cancer patients. Secondly, a method was developed for studying the implication of these distances on the dose by using the IC. This method compared the dose received by the structures in the CT, and the structures that were quadruply-deformed. The accuracy of the TPS was 1.7 ± 0.8 mm, and the distance obtained with the quadruply-deformed IC method was 1.7 ± 0.9 mm, i.e. the difference between the IC method multiplied by two, and that of the TPS validation method, was negligible. Moreover, the IC method shows very little variation in the dose-volume histograms when comparing the original and quadruply-deformed structures. This indicates that this algorithm is useful for planning adaptive radiation treatments using CBCT in head and neck cancer patients, although these variations must be taken into account when making a clinical decision to adapt a treatment plan.},

@article{Schwartz2011,
abstract = {PURPOSE: To present pilot toxicity and survival outcomes for a prospective trial investigating adaptive radiotherapy (ART) for oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 24 patients were enrolled in an institutional review board-approved clinical trial; data for 22 of these patients were analyzed. Daily CT-guided setup and deformable image registration permitted serial mapping of clinical target volumes and avoidance structures for ART planning. Primary site was base of tongue in 15 patients, tonsil in 6 patient, and glossopharyngeal sulcus in 1 patient. Twenty patients (91{\%}) had American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Stage IV disease. T stage distribution was 2 T1, 12 T2, 3 T3, 5 T4. N stage distribution was 1 N0, 2 N1, 5 N2a, 12 N2b, and 2 N2c. Of the patients, 21 (95{\%}) received systemic therapy. RESULTS: With a 31-month median follow-up (range, 13-45 months), there has been no primary site failure and 1 nodal relapse, yielding 100{\%} local and 95{\%} regional disease control at 2 years. Baseline tumor size correlated with absolute volumetric treatment response (p = 0.018). Parotid volumetric change correlated with duration of feeding tube placement (p = 0.025). Acute toxicity was comparable to that observed with conventional intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). Chronic toxicity and functional outcomes beyond 1 year were tabulated. CONCLUSION: This is the first prospective evaluation of morbidity and survival outcomes in patients with locally advanced head-and-neck cancer treated with automated adaptive replanning. ART can provide dosimetric benefit with only one or two mid-treatment replanning events. Our preliminary clinical outcomes document functional recovery and preservation of disease control at 1-year follow-up and beyond.},

@article{Kumarasiri2014,
abstract = {Purpose: To evaluate the clinical potential of deformable image registration (DIR)-based automatic propagation of physician-drawn contours from a planning CT to midtreatment CT images for head and neck (H{\&}N) adaptive radiotherapy. Methods: Ten H{\&}N patients, each with a planning CT (CT1) and a subsequent CT (CT2) taken approximately 3–4 week into treatment, were considered retrospectively. Clinically relevant organs and targets were manually delineated by a radiation oncologist on both sets of images. Four commercial DIR algorithms, two B-spline-based and two Demons-based, were used to deform CT1 and the relevant contour sets onto corresponding CT2 images. Agreement of the propagated contours with manually drawn contours on CT2 was visually rated by four radiation oncologists in a scale from 1 to 5, the volume overlap was quantified using Dice coefficients, and a distance analysis was done using center of mass (CoM) displacements and Hausdorff distances (HDs). Performance of these four commercial algorithms was validated using a parameter-optimized Elastix DIR algorithm. Results: All algorithms attained Dice coefficients of >0.85 for organs with clear boundaries and those with volumes >9 cm3. Organs with volumes <3 cm3 and/or those with poorly defined boundaries showed Dice coefficients of ∼0.5–0.6. For the propagation of small organs (<3 cm3), the B-splinebased algorithms showed higher mean Dice values (Dice = 0.60) than the Demons-based algorithms (Dice = 0.54). For the gross and planning target volumes, the respective mean Dice coefficients were 0.8 and 0.9. There was no statistically significant difference in the Dice coefficients, CoM, or HD among investigated DIR algorithms. The mean radiation oncologist visual scores of the four algorithms ranged from 3.2 to 3.8, which indicated that the quality of transferred contours was “clinically acceptable with minor modification or major modification in a small number of contours.” Conclusions: Use of DIR-based contour propagation in the routine clinical setting is expected to increase the efficiency of H{\&}N replanning, reducing the amount of time needed for manual target and organ delineations.},

abstract = {Purpose: To evaluate the first clinical results of an off-line adaptive radiotherapy (ART) protocol for prostate cancer using kilovoltage cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) in combination with a diet and mild laxatives. Methods and Materials: Twenty-three patients began treatment with a planning target volume (PTV) margin of 10 mm. The CBCT scans acquired during the first six fractions were used to generate an average prostate clinical target volume (AV-CTV), and average rectum (AV-Rect). Using these structures, a new treatment plan was generated with a 7-mm PTV margin. Weekly CBCT scans were used to monitor the CTV coverage. A diet and mild laxatives were introduced to improve image quality and reduce prostate motion. Results: Twenty patients were treated with conform ART protocol. For these patients, 91{\%} of the CBCT scans could be used to calculate the AV-CTV and AV-Rect. In 96{\%} of the follow-up CBCT scans, the CTV was located within the average PTV. In the remaining 4{\%}, the prostate extended the PTV by a maximum of 1 mm. Systematic and random errors for organ motion were reduced by a factor of two compared with historical data without diet and laxatives. An average PTV reduction of 29{\%} was achieved. The volume of the AV-Rect that received >65 Gy was reduced by 19{\%}. The mean dose to the anal wall was reduced on average by 4.8 Gy. Conclusions: We safely reduced the high-dose region by 29{\%}. The reduction in irradiated volume led to a significant reduction in the dose to the rectum. The diet and laxatives improved the image quality and tended to reduce prostate motion. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Adaptive radiotherapy (ART) can account for the dosimetric impact of anatomical change in head and neck cancer patients; however it can be resource intensive. Consequently, it is imperative that patients likely to require ART are identified. The purpose of this study was to find predictive factors that identify oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPC) and nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients more likely to need ART. MATERIALS AND METHODS One hundred and ten patients with OPC or NPC were analysed. Patient demographics and tumour characteristics were compared between patients who were replanned and those that were not. Factors found to be significant were included in logistic regression models. Risk profiles were developed from these models. A dosimetric analysis was performed. RESULTS Nodal disease stage, pre-treatment largest involved node size, diagnosis and initial weight (categorised in 2 groups) were identified as significant for inclusion in the model. Two models were found to be significant (p=0.001), correctly classifying 98.2{\%} and 96.1{\%} of patients respectively. Three ART risk profiles were developed. CONCLUSION Predictive factors identifying OPC or NPC patients more likely to require ART were reported. A risk profile approach could facilitate the effective implementation of ART into radiotherapy departments through forward planning and appropriate resource allocation.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate if cone beam CT (CBCT) can be used to estimate the delivered dose in head and neck intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: 15 patients (10 without replan and 5 with replan) were identified retrospectively. Weekly CBCT was co-registered with original planning CT. Original high-dose clinical target volume (CTV1), low-dose CTV (CTV2), brainstem, spinal cord, parotids and external body contours were copied to each CBCT and modified to account for anatomical changes. Corresponding planning target volumes (PTVs) and planning organ-at-risk volumes were created. The original plan was applied and calculated using modified per-treatment volumes on the original CT. Percentage volumetric, cumulative (planned dose delivered prior to CBCT + adaptive dose delivered after CBCT) and actual delivered (summation of weekly adaptive doses) dosimetric differences between each per-treatment and original plan were calculated.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: There was greater volumetric change in the parotids with an average weekly difference of between -4.1{\%} and -27.0{\%} compared with the CTVs/PTVs (-1.8{\%} to -5.0{\%}). The average weekly cumulative dosimetric differences were as follows: CTV/PTV (range, -3.0{\%} to 2.2{\%}), ipsilateral parotid volume receiving ≥26 Gy (V26) (range, 0.5-3.2{\%}) and contralateral V26 (range, 1.9-6.3{\%}). In patients who required replan, the average volumetric reductions were greater: CTV1 (-2.5{\%}), CTV2 (-6.9{\%}), PTV1 (-4.7{\%}), PTV2 (-11.5{\%}), ipsilateral (-10.4{\%}) and contralateral parotids (-12.1{\%}), but did not result in significant dosimetric changes.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: The dosimetric changes during head and neck simultaneous integrated boost IMRT do not necessitate adaptive radiotherapy in most patients.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: Our study shows that CBCT could be used for dose estimation during head and neck IMRT.},

abstract = {The purpose of this work is to present the results of a margin reduction study involving dosimetric and radiobiologic assessment of cumulative dose distributions, computed using an image guided adaptive radiotherapy based framework. Eight prostate cancer patients, treated with 7-9, 6 MV, intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) fields, were included in this study. The workflow consists of cone beam CT (CBCT) based localization, deformable image registration of the CBCT to simulation CT image datasets (SIM-CT), dose reconstruction and dose accumulation on the SIM-CT, and plan evaluation using radiobiological models. For each patient, three IMRT plans were generated with different margins applied to the CTV. The PTV margin for the original plan was 10 mm and 6 mm at the prostate/anterior rectal wall interface (10/6 mm) and was reduced to: (a) 5/3 mm, and (b) 3 mm uniformly. The average percent reductions in predicted tumor control probability (TCP) in the accumulated (actual) plans in comparison to the original plans over eight patients were 0.4{\%}, 0.7{\%} and 11.0{\%} with 10/6 mm, 5/3 mm and 3 mm uniform margin respectively. The mean increase in predicted normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) for grades 2/3 rectal bleeding for the actual plans in comparison to the static plans with margins of 10/6, 5/3 and 3 mm uniformly was 3.5{\%}, 2.8{\%} and 2.4{\%} respectively. For the actual dose distributions, predicted NTCP for late rectal bleeding was reduced by 3.6{\%} on average when the margin was reduced from 10/6 mm to 5/3 mm, and further reduced by 1.0{\%} on average when the margin was reduced to 3 mm. The average reduction in complication free tumor control probability (P+) in the actual plans in comparison to the original plans with margins of 10/6, 5/3 and 3 mm was 3.7{\%}, 2.4{\%} and 13.6{\%} correspondingly. The significant reduction of TCP and P+ in the actual plan with 3 mm margin came from one outlier, where individualizing patient treatment plans through margin adaptation based on biological models, might yield higher quality treatments.},

abstract = {This paper provides an overview of image registration and data fusion techniques used in radiation therapy, and examples of their use. They are used at all stages of the patient management process; for initial diagnosis and staging, during treatment planning and delivery, and after therapy to help monitor the patients' response to treatment. Most treatment planning systems now support some form of interactive or automated image registration and provide tools for mapping information, such as tissue outlines and computed dose from one imaging study to another. To complement this, modern treatment delivery systems offer means for acquiring and registering 2D and 3D image data at the treatment unit to aid patient setup. Techniques for adapting and customizing treatments during the course of therapy using 3D and 4D anatomic and functional imaging data are currently being introduced into the clinic. These techniques require sophisticated image registration and data fusion technology to accumulate properly the delivered dose and to analyse possible physiological and anatomical changes during treatment. Finally, the correlation of radiological changes after therapy with delivered dose also requires the use of image registration and fusion techniques.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The aim of this work was to compare the accuracy of different HU adjustments for CBCT-based dose calculation. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Dose calculation was performed on CBCT images of 30 patients. In the first two approaches phantom-based (Pha-CC) and population-based (Pop-CC) conversion curves were used. The third method (WAB) represents override of the structures with standard densities for water, air and bone. In ROI mapping approach all structures were overridden with average HUs from planning CT. All techniques were benchmarked to the Pop-CC and CT-based plans by DVH comparison and $\gamma$-index analysis. RESULTS: For prostate plans, WAB and ROI mapping compared to Pop-CC showed differences in PTV D(median) below 2{\%}. The WAB and Pha-CC methods underestimated the bladder dose in IMRT plans. In lung cases PTV coverage was underestimated by Pha-CC method by 2.3{\%} and slightly overestimated by the WAB and ROI techniques. The use of the Pha-CC method for head-neck IMRT plans resulted in difference in PTV coverage up to 5{\%}. Dose calculation with WAB and ROI techniques showed better agreement with pCT than conversion curve-based approaches. CONCLUSIONS: Density override techniques provide an accurate alternative to the conversion curve-based methods for dose calculation on CBCT images.},

The risks are therefore a parotid glands (PG) overdose and a xerostomia increase.The purposes of the study were to estimate:- the PG overdose and the xerostomia risk increase during a ¿standard¿ IMRT (IMRTstd);- the benefits of an adaptive IMRT (ART) with weekly replanning to spare the PGs and limit the risk of xerostomia.Material and methodsFifteen patients received radical IMRT (70Gy) for LAHNC. Weekly CTs were used to estimate the dose distributions delivered during the treatment, corresponding either to the initial planning (IMRTstd) or to weekly replanning (ART). PGs dose were recalculated at the fraction, from the weekly CTs. PG cumulated doses were then estimated using deformable image registration. The following PG doses were compared: pre-treatment planned dose, per-treatment IMRTstd and ART. The corresponding estimated risks of xerostomia were also compared. Correlations between anatomical markers and dose differences were searched.ResultsCompared to the initial planning, a PG overdose was observed during IMRTstd for 59{\%} of the PGs, with an average increase of 3.7Gy (10.0Gy maximum) for the mean dose, and of 8.2{\%} (23.9{\%} maximum) for the risk of xerostomia. Compared to the initial planning, weekly replanning reduced the PG mean dose for all the patients (p¿<¿0.05). In the overirradiated PG group, weekly replanning reduced the mean dose by 5.1Gy (12.2Gy maximum) and the absolute risk of xerostomia by 11{\%} (p¿<¿0.01) (30{\%} maximum). The PG overdose and the dosimetric benefit of replanning increased with the tumor shrinkage and the neck thickness reduction (p¿<¿0.001).ConclusionDuring the course of LAHNC IMRT, around 60{\%} of the PGs are overdosed of 4Gy. Weekly replanning decreased the PG mean dose by 5Gy, and therefore by 11{\%} the xerostomia risk.},

abstract = {Background and purpose: This study assessed the potential of tomotherapy based Image Guided Radiotherapy (IGRT) to increase the accuracy of bladder irradiation using a 'plan of the day' adaptive radiotherapy (ART) technique. Materials and methods: Ten patients with muscle invasive bladder cancer underwent bladder preservation with trimodality therapy in an ongoing trial. All patients received 64 Gy/32{\#} to the whole bladder and seven of them received a boost of 68 Gy/32{\#} to the tumour bed. The ART technique entailed the generation of six IMRT plans for each patient, using six isotropic PTVs of 5-30 mm applied to the bladder volume (CTV) to generate the PTVs. Megavoltage CT (MVCT) imaging was done to correct positioning errors and choose the 'plan of the day'. Results: Post treatment MVCT scans (315 scans) were used to generate multiple anisotropic PTVs for three hypothetical scenarios. Overall, coverage of anterior and superior walls required larger margins than other walls. Maximum geographical miss, in spite of IGRT, was noted for the superior (13.8{\%}) and anterior walls (10.3{\%}). Conclusions: Plan of the day ART is a feasible and promising technique for optimal treatment and dose escalation in bladder cancer. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd All rights reserved.

abstract = {Purpose: During a typical 5-7 week treatment of external beam radiotherapy, there are potential differences between planned patient's anatomy and positioning, such as patient weight loss, or treatment setup. The discrepancies between planned and delivered doses resulting from these differences could be significant, especially in IMRT where dose distributions tightly conforms to target volumes while avoiding organs-at-risk. We developed an automatic system to monitor delivered dose using daily imaging. Methods: For each treatment, a merged image is generated by registering the daily pre-treatment setup image and planning CT using treatment position information extracted from the Tomotherapy archive. The treatment dose is then computed on this merged image using our in-house convolution-superposition based dose calculator implemented on GPU. The deformation field between merged and planning CT is computed using the Morphon algorithm. The planning structures and treatment doses are subsequently warped for analysis and dose accumulation. All results are saved in DICOM format with private tags and organized in a database. Due to the overwhelming amount of information generated, a customizable tolerance system is used to flag potential treatment errors or significant anatomical changes. A web-based system and a DICOM-RT viewer were developed for reporting and reviewing the results. Results: More than 30 patients were analysed retrospectively. Our in-house dose calculator passed 97{\%} gamma test evaluated with 2{\%} dose difference and 2mm distance-to-agreement compared with Tomotherapy calculated dose, which is considered sufficient for adaptive radiotherapy purposes. Evaluation of the deformable registration through visual inspection showed acceptable and consistent results, except for cases with large or unrealistic deformation. Our automatic flagging system was able to catch significant patient setup errors or anatomical changes. Conclusions: We developed an automatic dose verification system that quantifies treatment doses, and provides necessary information for adaptive planning without impeding clinical workflows.},

abstract = {Contouring of targets and normal tissues is one of the largest sources of variability in radiation therapy treatment plans. Contours thus require a time intensive and error-prone quality assurance (QA) evaluation, limitations which also impair the facilitation of adaptive radiotherapy (ART). Here, an automated system for contour QA is developed using historical data (the ‘knowledge base’). A pilot study was performed with a knowledge base derived from 9 contours each from 29 head-and-neck treatment plans. Size, shape, relative position, and other clinically-relevant metrics and heuristically derived rules are determined. Metrics are extracted from input patient data and compared against rules determined from the knowledge base; a computer-learning component allows metrics to evolve with more input data, including patient specific data for ART. Nine additional plans containing 42 unique contouring errors were analyzed. 40/42 errors were detected as were 9 false positives. The results of this study imply knowledge-based contour QA could potentially enhance the safety and effectiveness of RT treatment plans as well as increase the efficiency of the treatment planning process, reducing labor and the cost of therapy for patients.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the appropriateness of using computed tomography (CT) to cone-beam CT (CBCT) deformable image registration (DIR) for the application of calculating the "dose of the day" received by a head and neck patient.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: NiftyReg is an open-source registration package implemented in our institution. The affine registration uses a Block Matching-based approach, while the deformable registration is a GPU implementation of the popular B-spline Free Form Deformation algorithm. Two independent tests were performed to assess the suitability of our registrations methodology for "dose of the day" calculations in a deformed CT. A geometric evaluation was performed to assess the ability of the DIR method to map identical structures between the CT and CBCT datasets. Features delineated in the planning CT were warped and compared with features manually drawn on the CBCT. The authors computed the dice similarity coefficient (DSC), distance transformation, and centre of mass distance between features. A dosimetric evaluation was performed to evaluate the clinical significance of the registrations errors in the application proposed and to identify the limitations of the approximations used. Dose calculations for the same intensity-modulated radiation therapy plan on the deformed CT and replan CT were compared. Dose distributions were compared in terms of dose differences (DD), gamma analysis, target coverage, and dose volume histograms (DVHs). Doses calculated in a rigidly aligned CT and directly in an extended CBCT were also evaluated.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: A mean value of 0.850 in DSC was achieved in overlap between manually delineated and warped features, with the distance between surfaces being less than 2 mm on over 90{\%} of the pixels. Deformable registration was clearly superior to rigid registration in mapping identical structures between the two datasets. The dose recalculated in the deformed CT is a good match to the dose calculated on a replan CT. The DD is smaller than 2{\%} of the prescribed dose on 90{\%} of the body's voxels and it passes a 2{\%} and 2 mm gamma-test on over 95{\%} of the voxels. Target coverage similarity was assessed in terms of the 95{\%}-isodose volumes. A mean value of 0.962 was obtained for the DSC, while the distance between surfaces is less than 2 mm in 95.4{\%} of the pixels. The method proposed provided adequate dose estimation, closer to the gold standard than the other two approaches. Differences in DVH curves were mainly due to differences in the OARs definition (manual vs warped) and not due to differences in dose estimation (dose calculated in replan CT vs dose calculated in deformed CT).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Deforming a planning CT to match a daily CBCT provides the tools needed for the calculation of the "dose of the day" without the need to acquire a new CT. The initial clinical application of our method will be weekly offline calculations of the "dose of the day," and use this information to inform adaptive radiotherapy (ART). The work here presented is a first step into a full implementation of a "dose-driven" online ART.},

@article{Castelli2014,
abstract = {Radiotherapy (RT), alone or combined with surgery and/or chemotherapy is given to almost all head and neck cancer (HNC). The goal of RT is to increase as much as possible the dose in the tumor to cure the patient, while limiting the dose in the organs at risk, mainly the parotids gland to limit the xerostomia. HNC RT appears particularly challenging due to the complexity of the shape of the anatomical structures, which also changes during the 7 weeks of treatment. Advances in imaging-modalities, -processing and -integration at the different RT steps have been crucial to develop a new image and dose-guided adaptive RT (ART) strategy. Moreover, the integration of functional imaging such as FDG-PET (performed before and during the treatment) leads to an even more highly targeted and dose-escalated ART. This article is an overview of the place and role of imaging at the different steps of HNCART, from a medical point of view. © 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS.},

abstract = {Quantitative validation of deformable image registration (DIR) algorithms is extremely difficult because of the complexity involved in constructing a deformable phantom that can duplicate various clinical scenarios. The purpose of this study is to describe a framework to test the accuracy of DIR based on computational modeling and evaluating using inverse consistency and other methods. Three clinically relevant organ deformations were created in prostate (distended rectum and rectal gas), head and neck (large neck flexion), and lung (inhale and exhale lung volumes with variable contrast enhancement) study sets. DIR was performed using both B-spline and diffeomorphic demons algorithms in the forward and inverse direction. A compositive accumulation of forward and inverse deformation vector fields was done to quantify the inverse consistency error (ICE). The anatomical correspondence of tumor and organs at risk was quantified by comparing the original RT structures with those obtained after DIR. Further, the physical characteristics of the deformation field, namely the Jacobian and harmonic energy, were computed to quantify the preservation of image topology and regularity of spatial transformation obtained in DIR. The ICE was comparable in prostate case but the B-spline algorithm had significantly better anatomical correspondence for rectum and prostate than diffeomorphic demons algorithm. The ICE was 6.5 mm for demons algorithm for head and neck case when compared to 0.7 mm for B-spline. Since the induced neck flexion was large, the average Dice similarity coefficient between both algorithms was only 0.87, 0.52, 0.81, and 0.67 for tumor, cord, parotids, and mandible, respectively. The B-spline algorithm accurately estimated deformations between images with variable contrast in our lung study, while diffeomorphic demons algorithm led to gross errors on structures affected by contrast variation. The proposed framework offers the application of known deformations on any image datasets, to evaluate the overall accuracy and limitations of a DIR algorithm used in radiation oncology. The evaluation based on anatomical correspondence, physical characteristics of deformation field, and image characteristics can facilitate DIR verification with the ultimate goal of implementing adaptive radiotherapy. The suitability of application of a particular evaluation metric in validating DIR is dependent on the clinical deformation observed.},

abstract = {OVERVIEW For adaptive radiotherapy it is common to collect images of the patient throughout the course of therapy. Because of tem- poral variations, however, it is usually necessary to deform images so as to merge them into a cohesive dataset. This im- age registration makes the accurate merging of dose distribu- tions difficult, if not impossible. Some have decided to do this by “deforming” the dose distributions, somewhat analogous to deforming the images, but it has been suggested that this is not appropriate. This is the premise debated in this month’s Point/Counterpoint.},

@article{Barateau2015,
abstract = {PURPOSE: We aimed to identify the most accurate combination of phantom and protocol for image value to density table (IVDT) on volume-modulated arc therapy (VMAT) dose calculation based on kV-Cone-beam CT imaging, for head and neck (H{\&}N) and pelvic localizations. METHODS: Three phantoms (Catphan(®)600, CIRS(®)062M (inner phantom for head and outer phantom for body), and TomoTherapy(®) "Cheese" phantom) were used to create IVDT curves of CBCT systems with two different CBCT protocols (Standard-dose Head and Standard Pelvis). Hounsfield Unit (HU) time stability and repeatability for a single On-Board-Imager (OBI) and compatibility of two distinct devices were assessed with Catphan(®)600. Images from the anthropomorphic phantom CIRS ATOM(®) for both CT and CBCT modalities were used for VMAT dose calculation from different IVDT curves. Dosimetric indices from CT and CBCT imaging were compared. RESULTS: IVDT curves from CBCT images were highly different depending on phantom used (up to 1000 HU for high densities) and protocol applied (up to 200 HU for high densities). HU time stability was verified over seven weeks. A maximum difference of 3{\%} on the dose calculation indices studied was found between CT and CBCT VMAT dose calculation across the two localizations using appropriate IVDT curves. One IVDT curve per localization can be established with a bi-monthly verification of IVDT-CBCT. CONCLUSIONS: The IVDT-CBCTCIRS-Head phantom with the Standard-dose Head protocol was the most accurate combination for dose calculation on H{\&}N CBCT images. For pelvic localizations, the IVDT-CBCTCheese established with the Standard Pelvis protocol provided the best accuracy.},

@article{Noel2014a,
abstract = {PURPOSE: Intensity-modulated adaptive radiotherapy (ART) has been the focus of considerable research and developmental work due to its potential therapeutic benefits. However, in light of its unique quality assurance (QA) challenges, no one has described a robust framework for its clinical implementation. In fact, recent position papers by ASTRO and AAPM have firmly endorsed pretreatment patient-specific IMRT QA, which limits the feasibility of online ART. The authors aim to address these obstacles by applying failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) to identify high-priority errors and appropriate risk-mitigation strategies for clinical implementation of intensity-modulated ART. METHODS: An experienced team of two clinical medical physicists, one clinical engineer, and one radiation oncologist was assembled to perform a standard FMEA for intensity-modulated ART. A set of 216 potential radiotherapy failures composed by the forthcoming AAPM task group 100 (TG-100) was used as the basis. Of the 216 failures, 127 were identified as most relevant to an ART scheme. Using the associated TG-100 FMEA values as a baseline, the team considered how the likeliness of occurrence (O), outcome severity (S), and likeliness of failure being undetected (D) would change for ART. New risk priority numbers (RPN) were calculated. Failures characterized by RPN ≥ 200 were identified as potentially critical. RESULTS: FMEA revealed that ART RPN increased for 38{\%} (n = 48/127) of potential failures, with 75{\%} (n = 36/48) attributed to failures in the segmentation and treatment planning processes. Forty-three of 127 failures were identified as potentially critical. Risk-mitigation strategies include implementing a suite of quality control and decision support software, specialty QA software/hardware tools, and an increase in specially trained personnel. CONCLUSIONS: Results of the FMEA-based risk assessment demonstrate that intensity-modulated ART introduces different (but not necessarily more) risks than standard IMRT and may be safely implemented with the proper mitigations.},

abstract = {Background: Deformable image registration (DIR) is an attractive method for automatic propagation of regions of interest (ROIs) in adaptive lung radiotherapy. This study investigates DIR for automatic contour propagation in adaptive Non Small Cell Lung Carcinoma patients. Methods: Pre and mid-treatment fan beam 4D-kVCT scans were taken for 17 NSCLC patients. Gross tumour volumes (GTV), nodal-GTVs, lungs, esophagus and spinal cord were delineated on all kVCT scans. ROIs were propagated from pre- to mid-treatment images using three DIR algorithms. DIR-propagated ROIs were compared with physician-drawn ROIs on the mid-treatment scan using the Dice score and the mean slicewise Hausdorff distance to agreement (MSHD). A physician scored the DIR-propagated ROIs based on clinical utility. Results: Good agreement between the DIR-propagated and physician drawn ROIs was observed for the lungs and spinal cord. Agreement was not as good for the nodal-GTVs and esophagus, due to poor soft-tissue contrast surrounding these structures. 96{\%} of OARs and 85{\%} of target volumes were scored as requiring no or minor adjustments. Conclusions: DIR has been shown to be a clinically useful method for automatic contour propagation in adaptive radiotherapy however thorough assessment of propagated ROIs by the treating physician is recommended.},

abstract = {The actual distribution of radiation dose accumulated in normal tissues over the complete course of radiation therapy is, in general, poorly quantified. Differences in the patient anatomy between planning and treatment can occur gradually (e.g., tumor regression, resolution of edema) or relatively rapidly (e.g., bladder filling, breathing motion) and these undermine the accuracy of the planned dose distribution. Current efforts to maximize the therapeutic ratio require models that relate the true accumulated dose to clinical outcome. The needed accuracy can only be achieved through the development of robust methods that track the accumulation of dose within the various tissues in the body. Specific needs include the development of segmentation methods, tissue-mapping algorithms, uncertainty estimation, optimal schedules for image-based monitoring, and the development of informatics tools to support subsequent analysis. These developments will not only improve radiation outcomes modeling but will address the technical demands of the adaptive radiotherapy paradigm. The next 5 years need to see academia and industry bring these tools into the hands of the clinician and the clinical scientist.},
