abstract = {A protocol is prescribed for clinical reference dosimetry of external beam radiation therapy using photon beams with nominal energies between 60Co and 50 MV and electron beams with nominal energies between 4 and 50 MeV. The protocol was written by Task Group 51 (TG-51) of the Radiation Therapy Committee of the American Association of Physicists in Medicine (AAPM) and has been formally approved by the AAPM for clinical use. The protocol uses ion chambers with absorbed-dose-to-water calibration factors, N(60Co)D,w which are traceable to national primary standards, and the equation D(Q)w = MkQN(60Co)D,w where Q is the beam quality of the clinical beam, D(Q)w is the absorbed dose to water at the point of measurement of the ion chamber placed under reference conditions, M is the fully corrected ion chamber reading, and kQ is the quality conversion factor which converts the calibration factor for a 60Co beam to that for a beam of quality Q. Values of kQ are presented as a function of Q for many ion chambers. The value of M is given by M = PionP(TP)PelecPpolMraw, where Mraw is the raw, uncorrected ion chamber reading and Pion corrects for ion recombination, P(TP) for temperature and pressure variations, Pelec for inaccuracy of the electrometer if calibrated separately, and Ppol for chamber polarity effects. Beam quality, Q, is specified (i) for photon beams, by {\%}dd(10)x, the photon component of the percentage depth dose at 10 cm depth for a field size of 10x10 cm2 on the surface of a phantom at an SSD of 100 cm and (ii) for electron beams, by R50, the depth at which the absorbed-dose falls to 50{\%} of the maximum dose in a beam with field size > or =10x10 cm2 on the surface of the phantom (> or =20x20 cm2 for R50>8.5 cm) at an SSD of 100 cm. R50 is determined directly from the measured value of I50, the depth at which the ionization falls to 50{\%} of its maximum value. All clinical reference dosimetry is performed in a water phantom. The reference depth for calibration purposes is 10 cm for photon beams and 0.6R50-0.1 cm for electron beams. For photon beams clinical reference dosimetry is performed in either an SSD or SAD setup with a 10x10 cm2 field size defined on the phantom surface for an SSD setup or at the depth of the detector for an SAD setup. For electron beams clinical reference dosimetry is performed with a field size of > or =10x10 cm2 (> or =20x20 cm2 for R50>8.5 cm) at an SSD between 90 and 110 cm. This protocol represents a major simplification compared to the AAPM's TG-21 protocol in the sense that large tables of stopping-power ratios and mass-energy absorption coefficients are not needed and the user does not need to calculate any theoretical dosimetry factors. Worksheets for various situations are presented along with a list of equipment required.},

abstract = {In photon beam convolution calculations where polyenergetic energy deposition kernels (EDKS) are used, the primary photon energy spectrum should be correctly accounted for in Monte Carlo generation of EDKS. This requires the probability of interaction, determined by the linear attenuation coefficient, mu, to be taken into account when primary photon interactions are forced to occur at the EDK origin. The use of primary and scattered EDKS generated with a fixed photon spectrum can give rise to an error in the dose calculation due to neglecting the effects of beam hardening with depth. The proportion of primary photon energy that is transferred to secondary electrons increases with depth of interaction, due to the increase in the ratio mu ab/mu as the beam hardens. Convolution depth-dose curves calculated using polyenergetic EDKS generated for the primary photon spectra which exist at depths of 0, 20 and 40 cm in water, show a fall-off which is too steep when compared with EGS4 Monte Carlo results. A beam hardening correction factor applied to primary and scattered 0 cm EDKS, based on the ratio of kerma to terma at each depth, gives primary, scattered and total dose in good agreement with Monte Carlo results.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To determine detector-specific output correction factors,[Formula: see text], in 6 MV small photon beams for air and liquid ionization chambers, silicon diodes, and diamond detectors from two manufacturers.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Field output factors, defined according to the international formalism published byAlfonso et al. [Med. Phys. 35, 5179-5186 (2008)], relate the dosimetry of small photon beams to that of the machine-specific reference field; they include a correction to measured ratios of detector readings, conventionally used as output factors in broad beams. Output correction factors were calculated with the PENELOPE Monte Carlo (MC) system with a statistical uncertainty (type-A) of 0.15{\%} or lower. The geometries of the detectors were coded using blueprints provided by the manufacturers, and phase-space files for field sizes between 0.5 × 0.5 cm(2) and 10 × 10 cm(2) from a Varian Clinac iX 6 MV linac used as sources. The output correction factors were determined scoring the absorbed dose within a detector and to a small water volume in the absence of the detector, both at a depth of 10 cm, for each small field and for the reference beam of 10 × 10 cm(2).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The Monte Carlo calculated output correction factors for the liquid ionization chamber and the diamond detector were within about ± 1{\%} of unity even for the smallest field sizes. Corrections were found to be significant for small air ionization chambers due to their cavity dimensions, as expected. The correction factors for silicon diodes varied with the detector type (shielded or unshielded), confirming the findings by other authors; different corrections for the detectors from the two manufacturers were obtained. The differences in the calculated factors for the various detectors were analyzed thoroughly and whenever possible the results were compared to published data, often calculated for different accelerators and using the EGSnrc MC system. The differences were used to estimate a type-B uncertainty for the correction factors. Together with the type-A uncertainty from the Monte Carlo calculations, an estimation of the combined standard uncertainty was made, assigned to the mean correction factors from various estimates.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The present work provides a consistent and specific set of data for the output correction factors of a broad set of detectors in a Varian Clinac iX 6 MV accelerator and contributes to improving the understanding of the physics of small photon beams. The correction factors cannot in general be neglected for any detector and, as expected, their magnitude increases with decreasing field size. Due to the reduced number of clinical accelerator types currently available, it is suggested that detector output correction factors be given specifically for linac models and field sizes, rather than for a beam quality specifier that necessarily varies with the accelerator type and field size due to the different electron spot dimensions and photon collimation systems used by each accelerator model.},

abstract = {The objective of this work was to measure the performance characteristics of a double-focus multileaf collimator (MLC) for intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), specifically the variation in penumbra and leakage for narrow fields as a function of field position over a 20x27 cm space available for segmented MLC IMRT. Measurements were made with 6 MV x rays through a MLC containing 29 leaf pairs (27 pairs of 1 cm width), and EDR2 film at 10 cm depth in solid water at 100 cm SAD. Films were digitized with 0.17 mm resolution and converted to dose. Interleaf and intraleaf transmission were measured along 11 vertical profile locations. Leaf-end transmission was measured along horizontal profiles for each of 9 different leaf abutments, traveling over a 20 cm range. In-plane penumbra measurements were made through a single leaf retracted, for 7 different leaves. Cross-plane penumbra (leaf-end) measurements were made for all 27 leaf pairs, where the 1 cm field width was placed in 11 different off-axis positions (20 cm range). Interleaf leakage (range 1.0{\%}-1.5{\%}), intraleaf transmission (range 0.6{\%}-0.8{\%}), and leaf-end transmission (range 0.8{\%}-2.7{\%}) were consistent for all leaf pairs at a given abutment position. The penumbra for these 1-cm-wide fields was measured to be 0.36 cm+/-0.03 cm for 99{\%} of the measurements. In conclusion, the penumbra and leakage of the double-focus MLC were remarkably consistent for the range of leaf positions studied, producing dosimetric characteristics that are well suited for IMRT segments where opposing leaf pairs are often separated by 10 mm or less.},

abstract = {The use of small fields in radiotherapy techniques has increased substantially, in particular in stereotactic treatments and large uniform or nonuniform fields that are composed of small fields such as for intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). This has been facilitated by the increased availability of standard and add-on multileaf collimators and a variety of new treatment units. For these fields, dosimetric errors have become considerably larger than in conventional beams mostly due to two reasons; (i) the reference conditions recommended by conventional Codes of Practice (CoPs) cannot be established in some machines and (ii) the measurement of absorbed dose to water in composite fields is not standardized. In order to develop standardized recommendations for dosimetry procedures and detectors, an international working group on reference dosimetry of small and nonstandard fields has been established by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in cooperation with the American Association of Physicists in Medicine (AAPM) Therapy Physics Committee. This paper outlines a new formalism for the dosimetry of small and composite fields with the intention to extend recommendations given in conventional CoPs for clinical reference dosimetry based on absorbed dose to water. This formalism introduces the concept of two new intermediate calibration fields: (i) a static machine-specific reference field for those modalities that cannot establish conventional reference conditions and (ii) a plan-class specific reference field closer to the patient-specific clinical fields thereby facilitating standardization of composite field dosimetry. Prior to progressing with developing a CoP or other form of recommendation, the members of this IAEA working group welcome comments from the international medical physics community on the formalism presented here.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: It has been proposed that conformal therapy can be carried out with static ports that are each individually compensated to deliver an optimal total dose distribution. If this proposal is to be implemented, one must have a means of compensating or modulating the fluence distributions within the boundaries of individual treatment fields. A theory was developed and implemented to achieve this goal. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The theory allowed creation of a leaf-setting sequence for a desired level of field-modulation precision. This method of beam modulation was experimentally verified using radiographic film to integrate the dose delivered by the sequence of discrete static multileaf collimator-defined subfields. RESULTS: Beam profiles were generated that matched the planned beam profiles to within the specified degree of precision. CONCLUSION: This methodology is a candidate for implementation of inverse planning for conformal therapy.},

The effects of lateral electron equilibrium (LEE) and electron contamination on the Sh values were studied. The EGS4 Monte Carlo technique was used to calculate the minimum beam radii (rLEE) required to achieve complete LEE for photon beams ranging from 60Co to 24 MV. The measurement shows that the error introduced to the Sh value due to lateral electron disequilibrium is negligible. The radii of the miniphantoms or the sidewall thicknesses of the caps can be reduced below rLEE provided they are thick enough to prevent the effect of electron contamination.},

This document is the report of Task Group 53 of the Radiation Therapy Committee of the American Association of Physicists in Medicine. The purpose of this report is to guide and assist the clinical medical physicist in developing and implementing a comprehensive but viable program of quality assurance for modern radiotherapy treatment planning. The scope of the QA needs for treatment planning is quite broad, encompassing image-based definition of patient anatomy, 3D beam descriptions for complex beams including multileaf collimator apertures, 3D dose calculation algorithms, and complex plan evaluation tools including dose volume histograms. The Task Group recommends an organizational framework for the task of creating a QA program which is individualized to the needs of each institution and addresses the issues of acceptance testing, commissioning the planning system and planning process, routine quality assurance, and ongoing QA of the planning process. This report, while not prescribing specific QA tests, provides the framework and guidance to allow radiation oncology physicists to design comprehensive and practical treatment planning QA programs for their clinics.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To implement radiotherapy with intensity-modulated beams, based on the inverse method of treatment design and using a multileaf collimation system operating in the dynamic mode. METHODS AND MATERIALS: An algorithm, based on the inverse technique, has been integrated into the radiotherapy treatment-planning computer system in our Center. This method of computer-assisted treatment design was used to derive intensity-modulated beams to optimize the boost portion of the treatment plan for a patient with a T1c cancer of the prostate. A dose of 72 Gy (in 40 fractions) was given with a six-field plan, and an additional 9 Gy (in five fractions) with six intensity-modulated beams. The intensity-modulated fields were delivered using dynamic multileaf collimation, that is, individual leaves were in motion during radiation delivery, with the treatment machine operating in the clinical mode. Exhaustive quality assurance measurement and monitoring were carried out to ensure safe and accurate implementation. RESULTS: Dose distribution and dose-volume histogram of the "inverse method" boost plan and of the composite (72 Gy primary + 9 Gy boost) plan were judged clinically acceptable. Compared to a manually designed boost plan, the inverse treatment design gave improved conformality and increased dose homogeneity in the planning target volume. Film and ion chamber dosimetry, performed prior to the first treatment, indicated that each of the six intensity-modulated fields was accurately produced. Thermoluminescent dosimeter (TLD) measurements performed on the patient confirmed that the intended dose was delivered in the treatment. In addition, computer-aided treatment-monitoring programs assured that the multileaf collimator (MLC) position file was executed to the specified precision. In terms of the overall radiation treatment process, there will likely be labor savings in the planning and the treatment phases. CONCLUSIONS: We have placed into clinical use an integrated system of conformal radiation treatment that incorporated the inverse method of treatment design and the use of dynamic multileaf collimation to deliver intensity-modulated beams. The system can provide better treatment design, which can be implemented reliably and safely. We are hopeful that improved treatment efficacy will result.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to create AAPM TG 119 benchmark plans for volumetric arc therapy (VMAT) and to compare VMAT plans with IMRT plan data. AAPM TG 119 proposes a set of test clinical cases for testing the accuracy of IMRT planning and delivery system. For these test cases, we generated two treatment plans, the first plan using 7-9 static dMLC IMRT fields and a second plan utilizing one- or two-arc VMAT technique. Dose optimization and calculations performed using 6 MV photons and Eclipse treatment planning system. Dose prescription and planning objectives were set according to the TG 119 goals. Plans were scored based on TG 119 planning objectives. Treatment plans were compared using conformity index (CI) for reference dose and homogeneity index (HI) (for D(5)-D(95)). For test cases prostate, head-and-neck, C-shape and multitarget prescription dose are 75.6 Gy, 50.4 Gy, 50 Gy and 50 Gy, respectively. VMAT dose distributions were comparable to dMLC IMRT plans. Our planning results matched TG 119 planning results. For treatment plans studied, conformity indices ranged from 1.05-1.23 (IMRT) and 1.04-1.23 (VMAT). Homogeneity indices ranged from 4.6{\%}-11.0{\%} (IMRT) and 4.6{\%}-10.5{\%} (VMAT). The ratio of total monitor units necessary for dMLC IMRT to that of VMAT was in the range of 1.1-2.0. AAPM TG 119 test cases are useful to generate VMAT benchmark plans. At preclinical implementation stage, plan comparison of VMAT and IMRT plans of AAPM TG 119 test case allowed us to understand basic capabilities of VMAT technique.},

abstract = {The commissioning of a three-dimensional treatment planning system requires comparisons of measured and calculated dose distributions. Techniques have been developed to facilitate quantitative comparisons, including superimposed isodoses, dose-difference, and distance-to-agreement (DTA) distributions. The criterion for acceptable calculation performance is generally defined as a tolerance of the dose and DTA in regions of low and high dose gradients, respectively. The dose difference and DTA distributions complement each other in their useful regions. A composite distribution has recently been developed that presents the dose difference in regions that fail both dose-difference and DTA comparison criteria. Although the composite distribution identifies locations where the calculation fails the preselected criteria, no numerical quality measure is provided for display or analysis. A technique is developed to unify dose distribution comparisons using the acceptance criteria. The measure of acceptability is the multidimensional distance between the measurement and calculation points in both the dose and the physical distance, scaled as a fraction of the acceptance criteria. In a space composed of dose and spatial coordinates, the acceptance criteria form an ellipsoid surface, the major axis scales of which are determined by individual acceptance criteria and the center of which is located at the measurement point in question. When the calculated dose distribution surface passes through the ellipsoid, the calculation passes the acceptance test for the measurement point. The minimum radial distance between the measurement point and the calculation points (expressed as a surface in the dose-distance space) is termed the gamma index. Regions where gamma > 1 correspond to locations where the calculation does not meet the acceptance criteria. The determination of gamma throughout the measured dose distribution provides a presentation that quantitatively indicates the calculation accuracy. Examples of a 6 MV beam penumbra are used to illustrate the gamma index.},

@article{Otto2008,
abstract = {In this work a novel plan optimization platform is presented where treatment is delivered efficiently and accurately in a single dynamically modulated arc. Improvements in patient care achieved through image-guided positioning and plan adaptation have resulted in an increase in overall treatment times. Intensity-modulated radiation therapy(IMRT) has also increased treatment time by requiring a larger number of beam directions, increased monitor units (MU), and, in the case of tomotherapy, a slice-by-slice delivery. In order to maintain a similar level of patient throughput it will be necessary to increase the efficiency of treatmentdelivery. The solution proposed here is a novel aperture-based algorithm for treatment plan optimization where dose is delivered during a single gantry arc of up to 360 deg. The technique is similar to tomotherapy in that a full 360 deg of beam directions are available for optimization but is fundamentally different in that the entire dose volume is delivered in a single source rotation. The new technique is referred to as volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT). Multileaf collimator(MLC) leaf motion and number of MU per degree of gantry rotation is restricted during the optimization so that gantry rotation speed, leaf translation speed, and dose rate maxima do not excessively limit the delivery efficiency. During planning, investigators model continuous gantry motion by a coarse sampling of static gantry positions and fluence maps or MLC aperture shapes. The technique presented here is unique in that gantry and MLC position sampling is progressively increased throughout the optimization. Using the full gantry range will theoretically provide increased flexibility in generating highly conformal treatment plans. In practice, the additional flexibility is somewhat negated by the additional constraints placed on the amount of MLC leaf motion between gantry samples. A series of studies are performed that characterize the relationship between gantry and MLC sampling, dose modeling accuracy, and optimization time. Results show that gantry angle and MLC sample spacing as low as 1 deg and 0.5 cm, respectively, is desirable for accurate dose modeling. It is also shown that reducing the sample spacing dramatically reduces the ability of the optimization to arrive at a solution. The competing benefits of having small and large sample spacing are mutually realized using the progressive sampling technique described here. Preliminary results show that plans generated with VMAT optimization exhibit dose distributions equivalent or superior to static gantry IMRT. Timing studies have shown that the VMAT technique is well suited for on-line verification and adaptation with delivery times that are reduced to ∼ 1.5 – 3   min for a 200 cGy fraction.},

@article{Venselaar2001,
abstract = {Background and purpose: To design a consistent set of criteria for acceptability of photon beam dose calculations of treatment planning systems. The set should be applicable in combination with a test package used for evaluation of a treatment planning system, such as the ones proposed by the AAPM Task Group 23 or by the Netherlands Commission on Radiation Dosimetry. Results: Tolerances have been defined for the accuracy with which a treatment planning system should be able to calculate the dose in different parts of a photon beam: the central beam axis and regions with large and small dose gradients. For increasing complexity of the geometry, wider tolerances are allowed, varying between 2 and 5{\%}. For the evaluation of a large number of data points an additional quantity, the confidence limit, has been introduced, which combines the influence of systematic and random deviations. The proposed tolerances have been compared with other recommendations for a number of clinically relevant examples, showing considerable differences, which are partly due to the way the complexity of the geometry is taken into account. Furthermore differences occur if criteria for acceptability of dose calculations are related either to the local dose value or to a normalized dose value. Conclusions: Although it is acknowledged that the general aim must be to have good agreement between dose calculation and the actual dose value, e.g. within 2{\%} or 2 mm, current day algorithms and their implementation into commercial treatment planning systems result often in larger deviations. A high accuracy can at present only be achieved in relatively simple cases. The new set of tolerances and the quantity confidence limit have proven to be useful tools for the acceptance of photon beam dose calculation algorithms of treatment planning systems. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.},

abstract = {The aim of this work was to investigate the accuracy of dose predicted by a Batho power law correction, and two models which account for electron range: A superposition/convolution algorithm and a Monte Carlo algorithm. The results of these models were compared in phantoms with cavities and low-density inhomogeneities. An idealized geometry was considered with inhomogeneities represented by regions of air and lung equivalent material. Measurements were performed with a parallel plate ionization chamber, thin TLDs (thermoluminescent dosimeters) and film. Dose calculations were done with a generalized Batho model, the Pinnacle collapsed cone convolution model (CCC), and the Peregrine Monte Carlo dose calculation algorithm. Absolute central axis and off axis dose data at various depths relative to interfaces of inhomogeneities were compared. Our results confirm that for a Batho correction, dose errors in the calculated depth dose arise from the neglect of electron transport. This effect increases as the field size decreases, as the density of the inhomogeneity decreases, and with the energy of incident photons. The CCC calculations were closer to measurements than the Batho model, but significant discrepancies remain. Monte Carlo results agree with measurements within the measurement and computational uncertainties.},

abstract = {Commissioning measurements for a multi-leaf collimator installed on a dual energy accelerator with 6 and 15 MV photons are described. Detailed dosimetric characterization of the multi-leaf collimator is a requirement for modeling the collimator with treatment planning software. Measurements include a determination of the penumbra width, leaf transmission, between-leaf leakage, and localization of the leaf ends and sides. Standard radiographic film was used for the penumbra measurements, and separate experiments using radiochromic film and thermoluminescent dosimeters were performed to verify that distortions of the dose distribution at an edge due to changing energy sensitivity of silver bromide film are negligible. Films were analyzed with a scanning laser densitometer with a 210 micron spot. Little change in the penumbra edge distribution was noted for different positions of a leaf in the field. Experiments localizing the physical end of the leaves showed less than 1 mm deviation from the 50{\%} decrement line. This small difference is attributed to the shaped end on the leaves. One side of a single leaf corresponded to the 50{\%} decrement line, but the opposite face was aligned with a lower value. This difference is due to the tongue and groove used to decrease between-leaf leakage. For both energies, approximately 2{\%} of photons incident on the multi-leaf collimator are transmitted and an additional 0.5{\%} leakage occurs between the leaves. Alignment of the leaves to form a straight edge results in a penumbra profile which compares favorably with the standard technique of using alloy blocks. When the edge is stepped, the isodose lines follow the leaf pattern and the boundary is poorly defined compared to divergent blocks.},

At each step, comprehensive quality assurance procedures are required to ensure the safe and accurate delivery of a prescribed radiation dose. This report deals with a comprehensive commissioning and ongoing quality assurance program specifically for treatment planning computers. Detailed guidelines are provided under the following topics: (a) computer program and system documentation and user training, (b) sources of uncertainties and suggested tolerances, (c) initial system checks, (d) repeated system checks, (e) quality assurance through manual procedures, and in vivodosimetry, and (f) some additional considerations including administration and manpower requirements. In the context of commercial computerized treatment planning systems, uncertainty estimates and achievable criteria of acceptability are presented for: (a) external photon beams, (b) electron beams, (c) brachytherapy, and (d) treatment machine setting calculations. Although these criteria of acceptability appear large, they approach the limit achievable with most of today's treatment planning systems. However, developers of new or improved dose calculation algorithms should strive for the goal recommended by the International Commission of Radiation Units and Measurements of 2{\%} in relative dose accuracy in low dose gradients or 2 mm spatial accuracy in regions with high dose gradients. For brachytherapy, the aim should be 3{\%} accuracy in dose at distances of 0.5 cm or more at any point for any radiation source. Details are provided for initial commissioning tests and follow-up reproducibility tests. The final quality assurance for each patient is to perform an independent manual check of at least one point in the dose distributions, as well as the machine setting calculation. As a check of the overall treatment planning process, in vivo dosimetry should be performed on a select number of patients.},

Each facility had passed the Radiological Physics Center credentialing tests for IMRT. The agreement between the planned and measured doses was determined using ion chamber dosimetry in high and low dose regions, film dosimetry on coronal planes in the phantom with all fields delivered, and planar dosimetry for each field measured perpendicular to the central axis. The planar dose distributions were assessed using gamma criteria of 3{\%}/3 mm.

abstract = {The production of off-focus x rays in the head of a 6 MV linac has been investigated using the EGS4 Monte Carlo code. The purpose of the study was to identify the sources of off-focus radiation and the relative contribution for each source. Even though a particular energy and linac were modeled, the broad conclusions are expected to be general since the effects of head scatter are similar for most conventional head designs, regardless of manufacturer, energy, and model. The head components that were modeled include the exit window of the accelerating structure, target, beam stopper, flattening filter, monitor chamber, primary and secondary collimators, and air. Monoenergetic 6 MeV electrons were followed through the exit window, target, and beam stopper until all energy was expended. Primary- and higher-order x rays produced throughout the head were followed until they were either absorbed or passed through a plane at the isocenter. Sites of off-focus radiation were found to be diffusely distributed throughout the head, with the most intense sources being the primary collimator, flattening filter, and beam stopper. Data analysis shows that the collimator effect is determined primarily by the volume of the extended head-scatter source that is exposed to the point of measurement through the collimating system. The results of this study provide a rationale for developing extended source models to calculate the collimator factor for fields defined by arbitrary collimation. An additional advantage is an improvement in the agreement between measured and calculated isodose distributions.},
