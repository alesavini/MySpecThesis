@article{Chaney1994,
abstract = {The production of off-focus x rays in the head of a 6 MV linac has been investigated using the EGS4 Monte Carlo code. The purpose of the study was to identify the sources of off-focus radiation and the relative contribution for each source. Even though a particular energy and linac were modeled, the broad conclusions are expected to be general since the effects of head scatter are similar for most conventional head designs, regardless of manufacturer, energy, and model. The head components that were modeled include the exit window of the accelerating structure, target, beam stopper, flattening filter, monitor chamber, primary and secondary collimators, and air. Monoenergetic 6 MeV electrons were followed through the exit window, target, and beam stopper until all energy was expended. Primary- and higher-order x rays produced throughout the head were followed until they were either absorbed or passed through a plane at the isocenter. Sites of off-focus radiation were found to be diffusely distributed throughout the head, with the most intense sources being the primary collimator, flattening filter, and beam stopper. Data analysis shows that the collimator effect is determined primarily by the volume of the extended head-scatter source that is exposed to the point of measurement through the collimating system. The results of this study provide a rationale for developing extended source models to calculate the collimator factor for fields defined by arbitrary collimation. An additional advantage is an improvement in the agreement between measured and calculated isodose distributions.},

abstract = {A three-dimensional photon beam calculation is described which models the primary, first-scatter, and multiple-scatter dose components from first principles. Three key features of the model are (1) a multiple-scatter calculation based on diffusion theory, (2) the demonstration of the modulation transfer function of the radiation dose transport process, and (3) the use of the finite fast Fourier transform to perform the required convolutions. The results of calculations for cobalt-60 in a homogeneous phantom are used to verify the accuracy of the model.},

abstract = {The physics modeling, dose calculation accuracy and plan quality assessment of the RayStation (v3.5) treatment planning system (TPS) is presented in this study, with appropriate comparisons to the more established Pinnacle (v9.2) TPS. Modeling and validation for the Elekta MLCi and Agility beam models resulted in a good match to treatment machine-measured data based on tolerances of 3{\%} for in-field and out-of-field regions, 10{\%} for buildup and penumbral regions, and a gamma 2{\%}/2 mm dose/distance acceptance criteria. TPS commissioning using a wide range of appropriately selected dosimetry equipment, and following published guidelines, established the MLC modeling and dose calculation accuracy to be within standard tolerances for all tests performed. In both homogeneous and heterogeneous medi-ums, central axis calculations agreed with measurements within 2{\%} for open fields and 3{\%} for wedged fields, and within 4{\%} off-axis. Treatment plan comparisons for identical clinical goals were made to Pinnacle for the following complex clinical cases: hypofractionated non-small cell lung carcinoma, head and neck, stereotactic spine, as well as for several standard clinical cases comprising of prostate, brain, and breast plans. DVHs, target, and critical organ doses, as well as measured point doses and gamma indices, applying both local and global (Van Dyk) normalization at 2{\%}/2 mm and 3{\%}/3 mm (10{\%} lower threshold) acceptance criteria for these com-posite plans were assessed. In addition 3DVH was used to compare the perturbed dose distributions to the TPS 3D dose distributions. For all 32 cases, the patients QA checks showed > 95{\%} of pixels passing 3{\%} global/3 mm gamma.},

@article{Hoban1994,
abstract = {In photon beam convolution calculations where polyenergetic energy deposition kernels (EDKS) are used, the primary photon energy spectrum should be correctly accounted for in Monte Carlo generation of EDKS. This requires the probability of interaction, determined by the linear attenuation coefficient, mu, to be taken into account when primary photon interactions are forced to occur at the EDK origin. The use of primary and scattered EDKS generated with a fixed photon spectrum can give rise to an error in the dose calculation due to neglecting the effects of beam hardening with depth. The proportion of primary photon energy that is transferred to secondary electrons increases with depth of interaction, due to the increase in the ratio mu ab/mu as the beam hardens. Convolution depth-dose curves calculated using polyenergetic EDKS generated for the primary photon spectra which exist at depths of 0, 20 and 40 cm in water, show a fall-off which is too steep when compared with EGS4 Monte Carlo results. A beam hardening correction factor applied to primary and scattered 0 cm EDKS, based on the ratio of kerma to terma at each depth, gives primary, scattered and total dose in good agreement with Monte Carlo results.},
