@article{Arnfield2000,
abstract = {The aim of this work was to investigate the accuracy of dose predicted by a Batho power law correction, and two models which account for electron range: A superposition/convolution algorithm and a Monte Carlo algorithm. The results of these models were compared in phantoms with cavities and low-density inhomogeneities. An idealized geometry was considered with inhomogeneities represented by regions of air and lung equivalent material. Measurements were performed with a parallel plate ionization chamber, thin TLDs (thermoluminescent dosimeters) and film. Dose calculations were done with a generalized Batho model, the Pinnacle collapsed cone convolution model (CCC), and the Peregrine Monte Carlo dose calculation algorithm. Absolute central axis and off axis dose data at various depths relative to interfaces of inhomogeneities were compared. Our results confirm that for a Batho correction, dose errors in the calculated depth dose arise from the neglect of electron transport. This effect increases as the field size decreases, as the density of the inhomogeneity decreases, and with the energy of incident photons. The CCC calculations were closer to measurements than the Batho model, but significant discrepancies remain. Monte Carlo results agree with measurements within the measurement and computational uncertainties.},

abstract = {It is shown that, provided the effective atomic number remains constant, there is a general relationship between the variation of scatter with density and the variation with geometry of the system. A simplified analysis of the scatter contribution in water equivalent bodies is presented. This analysis leads to the definition of relative scatter absorption factors and the values of these factors in water equivalent materials are found by experiment for radiation with a half-value layer of 15 mm Cu. By the application of the general relationship between density of the body and geometry of the system values of the relative scatter absorption factors in bodies of other than unit density are deduced. These values may be employed in the calculation of the scatter dose delivered to points which lie in an inhomogeneous body. The practical importance of the results obtained is discussed with particular reference to the use of Transit Dose techniques.},

@article{Mzenda2014,
abstract = {The physics modeling, dose calculation accuracy and plan quality assessment of the RayStation (v3.5) treatment planning system (TPS) is presented in this study, with appropriate comparisons to the more established Pinnacle (v9.2) TPS. Modeling and validation for the Elekta MLCi and Agility beam models resulted in a good match to treatment machine-measured data based on tolerances of 3{\%} for in-field and out-of-field regions, 10{\%} for buildup and penumbral regions, and a gamma 2{\%}/2 mm dose/distance acceptance criteria. TPS commissioning using a wide range of appropriately selected dosimetry equipment, and following published guidelines, established the MLC modeling and dose calculation accuracy to be within standard tolerances for all tests performed. In both homogeneous and heterogeneous medi-ums, central axis calculations agreed with measurements within 2{\%} for open fields and 3{\%} for wedged fields, and within 4{\%} off-axis. Treatment plan comparisons for identical clinical goals were made to Pinnacle for the following complex clinical cases: hypofractionated non-small cell lung carcinoma, head and neck, stereotactic spine, as well as for several standard clinical cases comprising of prostate, brain, and breast plans. DVHs, target, and critical organ doses, as well as measured point doses and gamma indices, applying both local and global (Van Dyk) normalization at 2{\%}/2 mm and 3{\%}/3 mm (10{\%} lower threshold) acceptance criteria for these com-posite plans were assessed. In addition 3DVH was used to compare the perturbed dose distributions to the TPS 3D dose distributions. For all 32 cases, the patients QA checks showed > 95{\%} of pixels passing 3{\%} global/3 mm gamma.},

@article{Hoban1994,
abstract = {In photon beam convolution calculations where polyenergetic energy deposition kernels (EDKS) are used, the primary photon energy spectrum should be correctly accounted for in Monte Carlo generation of EDKS. This requires the probability of interaction, determined by the linear attenuation coefficient, mu, to be taken into account when primary photon interactions are forced to occur at the EDK origin. The use of primary and scattered EDKS generated with a fixed photon spectrum can give rise to an error in the dose calculation due to neglecting the effects of beam hardening with depth. The proportion of primary photon energy that is transferred to secondary electrons increases with depth of interaction, due to the increase in the ratio mu ab/mu as the beam hardens. Convolution depth-dose curves calculated using polyenergetic EDKS generated for the primary photon spectra which exist at depths of 0, 20 and 40 cm in water, show a fall-off which is too steep when compared with EGS4 Monte Carlo results. A beam hardening correction factor applied to primary and scattered 0 cm EDKS, based on the ratio of kerma to terma at each depth, gives primary, scattered and total dose in good agreement with Monte Carlo results.},

@article{Chaney1994,
abstract = {The production of off-focus x rays in the head of a 6 MV linac has been investigated using the EGS4 Monte Carlo code. The purpose of the study was to identify the sources of off-focus radiation and the relative contribution for each source. Even though a particular energy and linac were modeled, the broad conclusions are expected to be general since the effects of head scatter are similar for most conventional head designs, regardless of manufacturer, energy, and model. The head components that were modeled include the exit window of the accelerating structure, target, beam stopper, flattening filter, monitor chamber, primary and secondary collimators, and air. Monoenergetic 6 MeV electrons were followed through the exit window, target, and beam stopper until all energy was expended. Primary- and higher-order x rays produced throughout the head were followed until they were either absorbed or passed through a plane at the isocenter. Sites of off-focus radiation were found to be diffusely distributed throughout the head, with the most intense sources being the primary collimator, flattening filter, and beam stopper. Data analysis shows that the collimator effect is determined primarily by the volume of the extended head-scatter source that is exposed to the point of measurement through the collimating system. The results of this study provide a rationale for developing extended source models to calculate the collimator factor for fields defined by arbitrary collimation. An additional advantage is an improvement in the agreement between measured and calculated isodose distributions.},
